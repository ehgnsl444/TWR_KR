krasnoyarsk.1.t:0 "Five Year Plan"
krasnoyarsk.1.d:0 "Emulating the economic policy of the old Soviet Union before its disintegration at the hands of the Germans, Zhdanov has announced a new Five Year Plan in Krasnoyarsk, to improve our fledgling industry and build up our nation's economic potential.\n\nNow we must decide, should we focus more on civilian or military industry?"
krasnoyarsk.1.a:0 "Civilian Focus"
krasnoyarsk.1.b:0 "Military Focus"
krasnoyarsk.2.t:0 "First Soviet Congress"
krasnoyarsk.2.d:0 "As Zhdanov has successfully reinforced his position both within the Communist Party and across the territories of the Krasnoyarsk government as a whole, the first Krasnoyarsk Soviet Congress has been called and organised. Here, loyal members of the Krasnoyarsk Soviet will discuss and decide on the policies and direction of the Soviet in the future."
krasnoyarsk.2.a:0 "Civilian Focus"
krasnoyarsk.3.t:0 "Fate of the Cultists"
krasnoyarsk.3.d:0 "Walter Ciszek and his bizarre cultists have been crushed, but they remain under our imprisonment. Now, we must decide what to do with them. Of course, Ciszek himself and his inner circle of conspirators must be destroyed, but what to do with the many rebels who fought with him?"
krasnoyarsk.3.a:0 "Execute Ciszek, reintegrate others"
krasnoyarsk.3.b:0 "Execute leaders, exile the rest into Siberia!"
krasnoyarsk.4.t:0 "Krasnoyarsk Offers Unification"
krasnoyarsk.4.d:0 "Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Andrei Zhdanov has ruled the warlord state of Krasnoyarsk to our north. Due to similarities in our communist ideals, we've mostly had good relations. Now, Zhdanov has approached us with a greater request than ever - suggesting the unification of our territories into a single Siberian Soviet Republic. Should we accept this?\n\nWILL RESULT IN ANNEXATION"
krasnoyarsk.4.a:0 "Accept the offer"
krasnoyarsk.4.b:0 "Refuse"
krasnoyarsk.5.t:0 "Altai Accepts"
krasnoyarsk.5.d:0 "The Altai Confederation has accepted our offers for unification. We will be united into the Siberian Soviet Republic!"
krasnoyarsk.5.a:0 "Excellent"
krasnoyarsk.5.t:0 "Altai Refuses"
krasnoyarsk.5.d:0 "The Altai Confederation has unfortunately refused offers for unification."
krasnoyarsk.5.a:0 "What a shame"
krasnoyarsk.7.t:0 "Siberian Soviet Republic"
krasnoyarsk.7.d:0 "With new territories under our control, we can declare the Siberian Soviet Republic!"
krasnoyarsk.7.a:0 "Onwards!"
krasnoyarsk.8.t:0 "The Compromise"
krasnoyarsk.8.d:0 "Meetings have been held between the new Communist government and the Polish-led GULAG rebels. Though there have been significant differences between the two sides, the immediate and permanent closing of the remaining GULAGs and the release of all their inmates has warmed relations between the two 'enemy' sides. Now, with concessions on the part of the communists, a compromise has been found, and the new government now has the tentative backing of the GULAG rebels."
krasnoyarsk.8.a:0 "Excellent"
krasnoyarsk.9.t:0 "Siberia Stirs"
krasnoyarsk.9.d:0 "One of the ugliest remaining reminders of the Stalin era, from before the Soviet Union was shattered at the hands of the Germans, remains in the form of the GULAGs. These camps, full of political and regular prisoners, make use of harsh conditions and forced labour to extract work from thousands of people. Under Zhdanov's rule within the Krasnoyarsk government's territory, they have continued unabated, being the core of the warlord state's economy.\n\nNow, however, things are seemingly stirring. There are hushed whispers of plots in the air. The NKVD, trying to uncover this mystery, has so far found little. Unsubstantiated rumours point towards Walter Ciszek, a Polish-American priest that has been prisoner in the GULAGs for years, but this hearsay is not taken seriously by Zhdanov or the NKVD."
krasnoyarsk.9.a:0 "Suspicious indeed..."
krasnoyarsk.10.t:0 "GULAG Revolt"
krasnoyarsk.10.d:0 "This morning, as the sun rose over Siberia, shouts and cries of thousands were heard across the GULAGs. With extraordinary coordination, prisoners have risen up against their captives, raiding barracks and arming themselves with what they find and weapons stolen from the disabled guards. Reports are coming in, not only of GULAGs being liberated across our territory, but of columns of freed prisoners organising to march on Krasnoyarsk itself. Led by Ciszek and his band of Poles and other ethnic minorities, but also including large numbers of Russians, these militias are making progress towards Krasnoyarsk and our army is not in good position to stop them."
krasnoyarsk.10.a:0 "Revolution Succeeds"
krasnoyarsk.10.b:0 "Krasnoyarsk Garrison crushes the rebels"
krasnoyarsk.11.t:0 "Army Approaches Krasnoyarsk"
krasnoyarsk.11.d:0 "With communications so poor in Siberia, by the time orders had been received and Red Army units arrived back at the city of Krasnoyarsk itself, they found the city under the control of Ciszek and his loyal rebel supporters. Army officers are relatively confident that they could retake the city and restore the Soviet government, but at what cost? Perhaps simply allowing the rebels to build a new government and allying with it would be better."
krasnoyarsk.11.a:0 "Retake the city!"
krasnoyarsk.11.b:0 "Let the rebels win"
krasnoyarsk.12.t:0 "The Filioque Controversy"
krasnoyarsk.12.d:0 "As we set up our new Siberian Church, there are many decisions to be made as to our official interpretation of Christianity. Among them, one key one is our interpretation of the 'Filioque controversy'. Relating to the nature of the Holy Trinity and the interactions between its parts, it has caused a rift between Western and Eastern branches of Christianity. Ciszek himself and his Polish supporters are Catholics, but a more eastern interpretation may be more popular among the Russian majority of the region.\n\nWhich interpretation shall we adopt, one more fitting of a Russian Orthodox-inspired Church, or a more western-inspired one?"
krasnoyarsk.12.a:0 "Western interpretation"
krasnoyarsk.12.b:0 "Eastern interpretation"
krasnoyarsk.13.t:0 "Krasnoyarsk Requests Equipment"
krasnoyarsk.13.d:0 "As part of an effort to align towards us while strengthening themselves, word from our comrades in the Krasnoyarsk government under Zhdanov has arrived requesting we smuggle infantry equipment across Siberia to them. While this would of course help our socialist comrades, is it worth the cost?"
krasnoyarsk.13.a:0 "Send some rifles"
krasnoyarsk.13.b:0 "Politely refuse"
krasnoyarsk.14.t:0 "Soviets Accept"
krasnoyarsk.14.d:0 "The Soviet government in Perm has accepted our request, and has smuggled a few thousand rifles to our forces"
krasnoyarsk.14.a:0 "Excellent"
krasnoyarsk.15.t:0 "Soviets Refuse"
krasnoyarsk.15.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Soviet government in Perm has refused to send us any equipment, citing their own needs and the chances of it being intercepted by hostile factions"
krasnoyarsk.15.a:0 "Unfortunate"
krasnoyarsk.16.t:0 "Joint Attack on Novosibirsk"
krasnoyarsk.16.d:0 "As they move towards reunification with us, the Krasnoyarsk government has asked us to launch a joint attack on Novosibirsk, so our armies and territories can meet."
krasnoyarsk.16.a:0 "Agree to the plan"
krasnoyarsk.16.b:0 "Refuse"
krasnoyarsk.17.t:0 "Soviets Accept"
krasnoyarsk.17.d:0 "The Soviet government in Perm has accepted our request, and will attack Novosibirsk with us."
krasnoyarsk.17.a:0 "Excellent"
krasnoyarsk.18.t:0 "Soviets Refuse"
krasnoyarsk.18.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Soviet government in Perm has refused to the joint attack plan."
krasnoyarsk.18.a:0 "Unfortunate"
krasnoyarsk.18.b:0 "Attack alone anyway"
krasnoyarsk.19.t:0 "Krasnoyarsk Rejoins"
krasnoyarsk.19.d:0 "The Krasnoyarsk government has agreed to fully reintegrate itself into the Soviet Union, and have come under our direct control"
krasnoyarsk.19.a:0 "Excellent"
krasnoyarsk.20.t:0 "Krasnoyarsk Offers Alliance"
krasnoyarsk.20.d:0 "With numerous threats in Siberia and Russia as a whole, including the Perm Soviet government and other communists, the new Christian government of Krasnoyarsk has proposed the formation a new faction with us in charge, and them as members."
krasnoyarsk.20.a:0 "We will ally with them"
krasnoyarsk.20.b:0 "We don't need those cultists"
krasnoyarsk.21.t:0 "Russia Accepts"
krasnoyarsk.21.d:0 "The Vladivostok government has accepted our proposals, we have created a new faction between ourselves."
krasnoyarsk.21.a:0 "Excellent"
krasnoyarsk.22.t:0 "Russia Refuses"
krasnoyarsk.22.d:0 "The Vladivostok government has unfortunately refused our proposed alliance"
krasnoyarsk.22.a:0 "Unfortunate"
krasnoyarsk.23.t:0 "Integrate Krasnoyarsk"
krasnoyarsk.23.d:0 "Now that the small warlord state of Krasnoyarsk has come under our sphere, we should demand they integrate under our full control, with autonomy."
krasnoyarsk.23.a:0 "Demand Integration"
krasnoyarsk.23.b:0 "Leave them alone"
krasnoyarsk.24.t:0 "Vladivostok Demands Integration"
krasnoyarsk.24.d:0 "With our armies meeting, Vladivostok has demanded that we submit to the sovereignty of their government, though allows us to maintain considerable autonomy within the Republic.\n\nWILL RESULT IN ANNEXATION"
krasnoyarsk.24.a:0 "Accept"
krasnoyarsk.24.b:0 "Refuse"
krasnoyarsk.25.t:0 "Krasnoyarsk Accepts"
krasnoyarsk.25.d:0 "The Krasnoyarsk government has accepted integration"
krasnoyarsk.25.a:0 "Excellent"
krasnoyarsk.26.t:0 "Krasnoyarsk Refuses"
krasnoyarsk.26.d:0 "The Krasnoyarsk government has unfortunately refused integration"
krasnoyarsk.26.a:0 "Unfortunate"

Now, after the dust has settled and the inmates have returned into the vicinity of their camps, the time has come to finally stabilize our nation once more. We shall lead it to renewed greatness in the name of Andrei Zhdanov."
KRA_official_vatican_ties:0 "Destroy the Cultists"
KRA_official_vatican_ties_desc:0 "With the inevitable defeat of the priest's insurrection against us the time has come to decide his fate and that of his followers of the camps, who fought for his self proclaimed Holy Dominion. We shall decide carefully on what to do with them, but they shouldn't expect their sentence for such a betrayal to be light. First we need to deal with their American–Polish apostate who's responsible for this chaos..."
KRA_official_patriarchal_ties:0 "Expanding the GULAGs"
KRA_official_patriarchal_ties_desc:0 "These revolts have shown us that we can never be too sure of our own position and the state which our country is in. We shall make sure that something like this insurrection can never occur once more in the future by further extending the GULAGs. Where there's no man to complain, there's no problem!"
KRA_christ_seeks_investment:0 "Our Five Year Plan"
KRA_christ_seeks_investment_desc:0 "In order to ensure our future place in history and to solidify our control we need to expand our industrial might. Back in the 1920s the Soviet leadership introduced the so called Five Year Plans, which transformed the Russian economy from an agrarian one to a industrial one. We shall follow this example to turn Krasnoyarsk into an industrial powerhouse of Siberia!"
KRA_a_new_bishopric:0 "Expel the Poles"
KRA_a_new_bishopric_desc:0 "The Fate of the Poles that were involved in this insanity one may call a rebellion has been sealed. No longer shall we tolerate them on the grounds of our beloved land, the time has come to expel them from each and every last corner of our nation. All of them shall be expelled of this lovely soil to never return in their lifetime!"
KRA_monastic_order_investments:0 "Funding for our NKVD"
KRA_monastic_order_investments_desc:0 "To further ensure that there can be no future uprisings within or outside the GULAGs we need to make sure that our citizens are kept in check. Therefore, we need to expand the spending towards our NKVD so that we can grasp the citizens and camp inmates even more firmly. We shall see to it that all of our people, within or outside of the GULAGs, shall have nothing but total loyalty and politically correct opinions whose sole purpose it is to serve the leadership!"
KRA_christian_trade_organization:0 "Introduce Labour Troopers"
KRA_christian_trade_organization_desc:0 "\"Every Soldier a Worker, Every Worker a Soldier!\" With our rather limited resources we have to resort to more unorthodox ways of achieving our industrial buildup as well as uphold our military might at the same time.

KRA_theocratic_socialism:0 "The First Soviet Congress"
KRA_theocratic_socialism_desc:0 "At first thought to be nothing more than drunkard, who's only notable trait was his relationship towards Joseph Stalin, Andrei Zhdanov proved himself self to be an idealist follower of purified Communism who led his people into a better tomorrow. With the recent rebuilding after the chaos that ensued in our land being mostly finished at this point, the time seems fit to hold the First Soviet Congress in which we shall decide the political future of our reborn state. Workers of Krasnoyarsk, Unite!"

With the new resources and Industrial complexes we've gained we will soon rise to be a major power, and maybe we will be able to bring back to Motherland to its former glory."

KRA_new_ecumenical_council_desc:0 "Having smashed our way out of the GULAGs, stormed the apparatus of the Krasnoyarsk government and killed the oppressor Zhdanov, we now must establish a new government of freed people. The old headquarters will be repurposed to create a government of the freed, a new interim government to rule the Krasnoyarsk region."
KRA_the_primacy:0 "Red Army's Counterrevolution"
KRA_the_primacy_desc:0 "While many parts of the Krasnoyarsk Red Army quietly disapproved of Zhdanov's methods, and may have even supported the GULAG revolts, the rising to power of a Polish-American priest and his mad cult was too much for army units to tolerate. They have launched a counterrevolution, taking back the reins of power and reestablishing communist control over the region."
KRA_ordination_reform:0 "Expanding the Security Forces"
KRA_ordination_reform_desc:0 "The turmoil and infighting that has gripped Krasnoyarsk recently cannot be allowed to happen again.

KRA_christ_helps_poor_desc:0 "It is clear that the old GULAG work camps have caused nothing but trouble for our government. From radicalising its inmates to the subsequent revolution, these great prisons are nothing but a hindrance. They will be disbanded and all inmates released as free inhabitants of the region, and the existing structures turned into military bases and new towns."
KRA_god_of_all:0 "Approve Kalininism"
KRA_god_of_all_desc:0 "As we look for a new ideology for the communist party to follow having rejected the ways of the old leader Zhdanov, we should look to other former Soviet figures for inspiration. One that we hold in high regard is Kalinin, the official head of state of the Soviet Union during the Stalin era, but sidelined in that time. We will bring his ideas and words to the forefront among those of other leading socialist thinkers."
KRA_communal_distribution_charity:0 "Abandon Zhdanovshchina"
KRA_communal_distribution_charity_desc:0 "Until the revolution, the official ideology of the Krasnoyarsk government was Zhdanovshchina, or Zhdanov Doctrine. As recent events have shown, this set of policies is a failure, and has led only to cruelty and instability. We must, as a result, abandon this doctrine entirely and look for other versions of socialism to follow."
KRA_god_defends_weak:0 "Compromise With the Poles"
KRA_god_defends_weak_desc:0 "It was the Poles and other ethnic minority prisoners in the GULAG system who were the fiercest of the revolutionaries, and many of them understandably feel betrayed by our counter-revolution. Ideally, they would be sidelined and our agenda brought forwards, but their number makes this a counterproductive act. To stabilise our new government, we will negotiate with them for a compromise."
KRA_fly_in_converts:0 "Soviet Equipment"
KRA_fly_in_converts_desc:0 "Having established a new Soviet government in Krasnoyarsk, we should contact the main Perm government for assistance. While we are distant in Siberia, remnants of the old Soviet Union such as ourselves should cooperate in order to advance our own interests against reactionaries that have taken hold in Siberia."
KRA_the_righteous:0 "A Fortress Republic"
KRA_the_righteous_desc:0 "Here in Siberia, we are isolated from the world, and that is how it should stay. The Perm government, while the closest thing to a legitimate successor to the Soviet Union, has gone astray, and unfortunate as it is, the Soviet Union is gone. We should concentrate instead on rebuilding within the areas we control in this desolate corner of Siberia. Maybe socialism can be built away from any disturbance from imperialists."
KRA_those_who_sin:0 "Rejoin the Soviet Union"
KRA_those_who_sin_desc:0 "With the Krasnoyarsk government having restabilised itself under a new communist leadership, and reestablished diplomatic contact with the Perm Soviet government, our destiny of rebuilding the Soviet Union awaits.

KRA_the_otets:0 "Creation Of The Otetship"
KRA_the_otets_desc:0 "A new government, an ‘Otetship' will be created to replace the cruel communist breakaway regime which ruled over Krasnoyarsk and its territories before.

KRA_siberian_christendom:0 "Expanding Siberian Christendom"
KRA_siberian_christendom_desc:0 "Though we have liberated ourselves, many still toil under cruel warlords or communist officials across Siberia, including in GULAGs. Our great Christian state must liberate these oppressed faithful masses from the clutches of the faithless barbarians who oppress them. Only then can our new nation of the freed under God prosper in this barren land."
KRA_filioque:0 "Decision On Filioque"
KRA_filioque_desc:0 "As we create our new Siberian church as a key part of our new society, there are many ancient questions of Christianity to consider. For example, the Filioque controversy that has divided Christians for centuries must be resolved as our Church is established. This, and other questions, will be decided by Ciszek and his clergy."
KRA_appeasing_old_believers:0 "The Polish Officer Corps"
KRA_appeasing_old_believers_desc:0 "Though parts of the old Red Army have agreed to come to our side, within the GULAGs are a small number of mostly Polish former officers with military experience.

The more officers we have, the better organised our armies will be!"

KRA_adoption_of_eastern_sainthoods_desc:0 "Though much work remains, we have begun to build a new nation, a new fatherland, within this barren land of Siberia. The formerly oppressed, of all creeds, are now not only freed from their cruel imprisonment but now united in one purpose, under God, to build a new and better society. The new fatherland will be created with Ciszek at its helm!"
KRA_new_land_of_wonder:0 "A New Land Of Wonder"
KRA_new_land_of_wonder_desc:0 "There is little in these Siberian wastes. Scarcely are there any more inhospitable lands on earth. Yes, against the odds, we have begun to build a new and better society for freed people in the land of ice and snow. Now we have also set out to liberate others from their chains, we can truly build a new land of wonder in these barren lands."
KRA_old_land_of_pain:0 "A Telegraph to Russia"
KRA_old_land_of_pain_desc:0 "While communists lurk in the west and dangerous warlords surround us, to the far east, a Russian Republic built by White emigres stands strong and ready to advance west. Unfortunately, our small state simply does not have the strength to forge its own path alone, and we should contact the Russians of the Vladivostok Government for support and an alliance."
