    TWR_Mihn:0 "A Vietnamese nationalist through-and-through, Nguyen Sinh Cung was an impassioned student and activist during his early years. His youth as the son of a Confucian bureaucrat and an accomplished student, it was his father's unwillingness to serve the French colonisers and his own experiences serving aboard a steamer ship that solidified his revolutionary sentiments. Contact with fellow revolutionaries in the United States and United Kingdom pushed him forward, but it was the French Socialists that revealed the path of communism as one of Vietnamese liberation. Later visits to Russia, Thailand and China affirmed these beliefs. Returning to his homeland with the new name Ho Chi Minh and leading the nascent Viet Minh, Ho has liberated his home from the vultures that once fed on his beloved homeland. Now as traitors muster within and old empires reassemble without, some say that only Ho Chi Minh can protect and preserve the liberty that so many of his countrymen have bled and died for."

Going through the Cambodian and Laotian jungle, our south allows for our men in the north get reenforced with more safety and without the constant harassment of enemy air support."

Outside of the capital, the majority of our population still work the rice fields and travel on the ragged dirt roads barely connecting our cities. If we are to become a strong nation, we must address those issues immediatelly."

Among the many citizens are also officers and politicians of the Communist Party of Kampuchea, who are more than willing to help our government improve itself by filling up much needed political positions."

From the Trotskyists of the Struggle Group to the Kuomintang fanatics of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, our nation's ideological base is rocked continuously, making us a vunerable target to foreign political interests.

    twrvietnam.2.d:0 "Back when remnants of the Chinese Communist Party escaped into Vietnam, they brought with them a great amount of veterans and advisors for the regime. Ho Chi Minh personally welcomed the Chinese exiles and cooperated with Liu Shaoqi in forming a temporary CCP headquarters in Vietnam, gaining a considerable favour from the Chinese Communists.\n\nNow that the Republic of China is waging their imperialist invasion against the workers' sovereignty, Liu Shaoqi has made a decree, sending their commanders to lead groups of Chinese Veterans to aid the Vietnamese defense to retain independence.\n\nThese volunteers have sworn their loyalty, willing to fight to their deaths for the independence of Vietnam and the liberation of China."

    twrvietnam.3.d:0 "After a transport ship docked in a Vietnamese port, 600 men carrying the old banner of Lincoln-Washington Brigade from the Spanish Civil War disembarked, carrying with them weapons and supplies. After brief tension, further questioning shows that these men are here to volunteer for our fight against the Chinese imperialist tyrants.\n\nThis information was quickly relayed to the Central Government, which subsequently granted them their right to take part in our fight. However, besides a few talented officers and small arms, their cargo also consisted of 10 'stolen' old American fighter planes, making these volunteers into one of the most valuable asset acquired from foreign means.\n\nMilton Wolff, the leader of the group of American volunteers denied any connections with the American Government, though Ho Chi Minh has ordered that he has no interest in their origin."

    twrvietnam.4.d:0 "With the communists having come to power in India, a country of hundreds of millions has now been liberated from imperialism and joined the ranks of socialism. With this, there are many calling for us to officially join forces with the Indians and merge our own alliance of Asian socialist nations with theirs, with us and our allies joining their 'Indochinese Comintern'. Of course, this would strengthen socialism in Asia, but it would mean we allow India as the much large nation to lead the charge. Shall we ask them?"
    twrvietnam.4.a:0 "No, we are better as we are"
    twrvietnam.4.b:0 "We must join forces!"
    twrvietnam.5.t:0 "Vietnam Offers Unity"
    twrvietnam.5.d:0 "Now that we have built our own Comintern, the Vietnamese and their allies are coming to us, offering to merge our two blocs together. This would mean they join our faction, creating a large single united front under our command to lead socialism in Asia. Shall we accept?\n\n(If Vietnam joins, they may be able to invite new countries into the faction themselves in future)."
    twrvietnam.5.a:0 "No, we are better as we are"
