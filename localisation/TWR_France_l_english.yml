TWR_Moquet:0 "Arrested for distribution of propaganda and possession of communist poetry he had written, Guy Môquet was 17 when he was sent to a labor camp. He toiled away, repeatedly beaten, branded, whipped, and sodomized by the Nazi commanders due to his insistence on writing his poetry to inspire other prisoners and refusing to become broken or obedient. Only a week after his eighteenth birthday, the French Resistance attempted a daring rescue of their members held at several camps in Eastern France. Môquet tried to run, but like so many others, he was shot in the back by machine gun fire mere meters from freedom. The camp officers presumed him dead, and he was thrown in the nearest mass grave with the other prisoners as the botched escape was covered up. But Guy Môquet, while close to death, survived, awakening and crawling out of that wretched pit, full of bullets, before making his way to the closest village where he was nursed to health. Only 18 and legally dead, once he recovered, he returned to work for the Resistance, becoming a brutal fighter and brilliant propagandist. With so many Resistance leaders dead, the famed Boy Who Lived is the face of the RFL's radical socialists, often butting heads with Nicole Minet and her Marxist-Leninist faction."
TWR_Nicole_Minet:0 "Simone Segouin was only 18 when she began her time in the French Resistance, and since then she became adept as an operative and as a cell leader. In 1949, she agreed to embark on an odyssey across Europe, providing supplies, intel, and assistance to resistance cells across the continent. Zurich, Prague, Bratislava, Belgrade, Lublin, Vilnius, Kiev, she and her men arrived only to be met with impossible situations, suicide missions, and failing rebellions. When she arrived in the husk of Moscow, her faith in the cause of resistance was low. But there, seeing unspeakable horrors, facing perhaps the harshest of odds, her faith and that of her men was rekindled by a group of Marxist-Leninist freedom fighters who refused to give up the dream promised by Joseph Stalin, and even when the last of them died, the dream burned in Simone. Simone Segouin never returned home. In her place is Nicole Minet, Simone's nom de guerre that has become her identity; a virulent avowed Marxist-Leninist, hellbent on transforming France into a perfect proletariat dictatorship, guided by her vanguard party."
HenriDesc:0 "Henri of Orléans, the Count of Paris was born in northern France in 1908. Moving to Morocco the following year, Henri spent his early mornings helping on the family plantation; followed by extensive tutoring from foreign tutors. During this time, Henri picked up and became fluent in Arabic, English, German, Italian, Spanish as well as French. In 1923, he visited a Parisian low-class neighbourhood with a French tutor of his. Henri was appalled by the poor living conditions of the ordinary dry labourer and the experience forever changed his outlook on French politics and social justice. Becoming distasteful of the pampered childhood he had in Morocco after this, Henri moved to Belgium to study law, science and mathematics the following year; all while France passed a law exiling all monarchist pretenders from the country that very year. Having witnessed the German blitzkrieg and French armistice in 1940, Henri was able to move back to the new French State when it rescinded the law of exile. With François Darlan's assistance and now being stylized as Henri VI, the first King of France since 1848 is now in charge of a weakened and corrupt France. The road to making France strong at home and abroad again will be tough, but with a loyal parliament and competent politicians to fill it, the third Kingdom of France under Henri's leadership will surely shape up to be an entity to last the ages."

##Brasillach Events##

twrbrasillach.1.t:0 "골치아픈 루머들"
twrbrasillach.1.d:0 "Generally, all has been well since the Consulate's formation. The triumvirate of men have brought stability to France and created a one-party, but multi-ideology, system that has been a boon to the country in these strange times. And these men have been hailed as heroes, respected and beloved by the people, and none more so than Robert Brasillach. But rumors are starting to circulate. Even before he came to power, some whispered that Brasillach had... peculiar tastes. Some believed his bachelor status extended beyond merely not finding the right woman into have not yet found the right man. Homosexuality was not officially illegal under the puppet regime of the French State, but the Germans had Brasillach investigated for it before, though nothing came of it. Or so it was thought. Now there are rumors that something was found, and that it was only Doriot's protection that had kept the taciturn writer safe. Regardless of their veracity, these rumors have created a bit of a stir in France. Some wonder if they are true, and if so, if Brasillach should be punished. Homosexuality was not illegalized by the Consulate, but it has not been legalized by them either. Hopefully, however, these rumors will pass, and many of Supreme Consul Brasillach ‘le Sage' are decrying these rumors as nonsense propagated by France's enemies."

twrbrasillach.2.d:0 "The rumors concerning Brasillach's sexuality have not abetted. If anything, they have gotten worse. Many from the former PSF and numerous other Integralist and Clerical groups have stated that if the rumors are true, Brasillach must be removed from power, with some claiming he be arrested, fined, or even executed. Most of the public is generally supportive of the Supreme Consul, with even radical Catholics feeling he ought to simply be removed rather than any sort of punitive measure considering his numerous efforts for the betterment of France, and many defend their leader from these allegations. But enemies and allies alike are starting to ask: just what is the government's stance on homosexuality? Critics ask, If Brasillach is not a homosexual, why does he oppose illegalizing it? Of course, this is an unfair question, and secularists are increasingly stating that private life ought to be left alone, so long as public life is devoted to the state."

twrbrasillach.3.d:0 "Last night, the Supreme Consul received a letter claiming the writer would expose him as a homosexual if he did not transfer a million francs to their account. Thankfully, the imbecile used his own account, and he has been arrested, possessing no supposed evidence. However, death threats have trickled in as well, some just in the form of signs in public crowds. Radicals who believe in the rumors concerning Brasillach are growing bolder, to the point that they threaten France's hero and most powerful man. Brasillach himself is furious and frustrated, and de Jouvenel and Mitterand are themselves increasingly concerned about how these rumors will impact the legitimacy of the government. Regardless of how the situation is handled in the long-term, and regardless of if these rumors are found true, something must be done to deal with the blatant disrespect shown a Consul of the Demesne. Of course, plotting an assassination or committing extortion are crimes, but some worry such open hostility must be punished."

twrbrasillach.4.d:0 "'Good day. I am, as many know, Robert Brasillach, Supreme Consul of the French Demesne. This speech will be brief. Over the past few weeks, I have been beset by vile rumors against my character. Part of me wishes to deny these claims, but another part wants to iterate clearly and firmly that my known, proven accomplishments, all for the betterment of France, should always stand before wild accusations. Every morning, I wake and begin working to better France. And every night, I dream of how I may better France. In whose bed I rest ought to be irrelevant when one looks at my works. \n\nHowever... as I have said, I only want what is best for France. And despite the lack of proof presented for the claims against me, many have begun to wonder if they are true. Frenchmen argue with Frenchmen, lines are being drawn in the sand, sides chosen as some defend me and some demand for my removal. I love France. I love my people. I have never sought to divide, but to unite \n\nNow I stand at a controversy that divides people. If I deny these rumors, my critics will never believe me, and the argument will persist. If I were to fall on the sword and claim them true, a new debate would arise as to whether who is in my heart ought determine if I should lead. I would continue to divide France. I do not wish to do so. And so, with a heavy heart, I have decided I must resign. Effective immediately, I will no longer be Supreme Consul, and a new patriot will be chosen to join the Consulate. \n\nOne of my fellow senior Consuls will become Supreme Consul. As to whom of my two colleagues that is, that will be announced tomorrow. Glory to France. Glory to the French.' \n\n The nation is a bit stunned. Brasillach is retiring, in order to end any division his presence creates. Accusations are sure to end out of respect for such a selfless move. But now the question is which Consul will succeed him. Mitterand is far more moderate than Brasillach, and while the more popular condidate, some fear he will not be the revolutionary leader France needs. The inverse is found with de Jouvenel, who before joining the F3 Coalition, led the French National-Syndicalist Rally, a merger of the French National-Communists and neosocialist National Popular Rally. Some are concerned that, while he now labels himself a 'French fascist' he and his followers are just communists in disguise."

twrfrance.0.t:0 "프랑스국"
twrfrance.0.d:0 "Defeated in the Second World War by the German Blitzkrieg, the French State was established by armistice, a supposedly temporary state of affairs as the Germans continued the war. Once peace was established with the British and the Germans, France was eager to gain time for it's recovery from their own losses, presenting the Second Armistice to solidify this fragile peace, which to this day functions as a founding document of the French State.\n\nWithout an effective military force, a dismantled industrial capacity, and strict limits on the number of troops, weapons, and even ammunition that they can possess, the French State is not only no longer a direct threat to the Germans, but reliant on them for their defense. In addition, the Government of France is a corrupt mass of inefficiency and stagnation, led by politicians with conflicting rhetoric, while the Reichsvertreter serves as Germany's eyes within France. Since Petain's death, the Chef de l'État has been Maxime Weygand, who has proven himself an eager Nationalist, hunting down democrats, communists, and a number of other dissidents, while simultaneously fighting against German influence within Paris. Also, France's debt to the German Reich will likely never be paid off until the dawn of the third millennium, and this means that there are still regions of France where the scars of the European War remain unrepaired.\n\nThis humiliating state of affairs has been marked with the growth of the Free French Resistance (RFL, Résistance Français Libre) and the National Front (FINF, Front national de l'indépendance de la France), two organizations that threaten the stability of the nation, while internal opposition towards Germany is growing day by day."

But never in its history has France been in as bad a state as now. The former heart of European culture is bankrupt, disarmed and dismembered. It has become too much for Chief of State Weygand, change must be made. France is on the precipice, it shall not fall!"

 twrDoriotNew.1.t:0 "Libère-toi France!"
 twrDoriotNew.1.d:0 "Today is a historic day for France. The leader of the French Popular Party, Jacques Doriot, has been called by the new President, Admiral François Darlan, to form a new government for the first time since the end of the Third Republic. \n\nIt is a reversal of fortune for the former Communist Youth secretary, whom foreign press dubbed the 'French Führer' for his switch to ardent fascist collaborationism. Waiting for such an opportunity since 1940, Doriot's plan to save a fracturing France is a decade in the making. In tandem with Darlan who will take the place of Head of State, Doriot intends to dramatically reform France in order to restore it to its rightful glory and finally exorcise it's demons from within. \n\nThe former Marshal's right hand, now serving the Admiral, is seen by all good Frenchmen as the man for the job."
 twrDoriotNew.1.a:0 "With luck, France shall endure."
 twrDoriotNew.2.t:0 "Doriot Declares the Mise au Pas"
 twrDoriotNew.2.d:0 "France has always had enemies who seek to destroy it. These forces are easily seen, they are the Jews, the Freemasons and the Communists. Marshal Pétain in his national revolution had tried to expel them from the French Nation, but he had not gone far enough! Anti-French forces have succeeded in infiltrating Vichy and as the journalist Claud Jantet said; "Vichy is teeming with Jews and Masons!". Except that we are now in power, and as the Germans did with their Gleichschaltung, we shall do with our Mise au Pas!"
 twrDoriotNew.2.a:0 "Things are finally moving!"
 twrDoriotNew.3.t:0 "The Arrest of Nogues and his Partisans"
 twrDoriotNew.3.d:0 "Charles Noguès, general of the army, with his experience in Morocco, his loyalty to Marshal Pétain and General Weygand and especially for his total ideological submission to the National Revolution, was perceived as the protégé of Weygand. He has formed in Paris around the former head of state a clan made up largely of officers, nicknamed the Military Clan. With the takeover of the PPF by Doriot, Noguès is now a danger in addition to being totally useless, because the whole of the French army is loyal to the government and to Doriot. Eliminating this clan will allow us to reshuffle the military, silence some officers and strategically place our men to ensure full control of the PPF over the military."
 twrDoriotNew.3.a:0 "The army will be cleansed!"
 twrDoriotNew.4.t:0 "Jacques Doriot meets with Joseph Darnand and the Militia Chiefs"
 twrDoriotNew.4.d:0 "\n\nAt 7 am today, in the Château de Chambord,, Doriot, accompanied by Head of State Admiral Darlan met the Secretary General of the Militia, Joseph Darnand, his staff and all the other departmental heads. Darlan and Doriot know each other well, since the current militia leader was between 1936 and 1938 a member of the PPF which he had left to join the Cowl. \n\nDuring this day, Jacques Doriot made a two-hour speech to praise the French Militia, its leader In this speech Doriot called for deepening ties between the new powers. The main points having already been discussed between the General Staff of the Militia and the Directory of the PPF, Doriot listed them before officials of the Militia not informed. As the day progressed, the meeting became a rally of Doriot. Arriving at the points which stipulate the automatic adhesion of all the militiamen old and new to the PPF, the Chef finishes his speech by Doriotist salute, and Darnand gets up to return it, accompanied a second later by the rest of his officials."
 twrDoriotNew.4.a:0 "Here is Doriot's Militia."
 twrDoriotNew.5.t:0 "Doriot Gives Speech at the Ecole Normale Superieure"
 twrDoriotNew.5.d:0 "\n\nOn the advice of the former Normalien and very influential statesman, Pierre Pucheu. Jacques Doriot gave a speech at the École Normale Supérieure, the very prestigious French public higher education establishment from which the present administrators of the French state emerged. "It is here", Doriot said in his speech, "that the new elite will come out of our new France". Promising that all of the students of this school will be leaders of the popular state which is emerging and merits will be rewarded. By making this speech, Jacques Doriot enlists the support of a group of very influential people who are interested in his promises of the advent of a "new modern state"."
 twrDoriotNew.5.a:0 "Doriot, the first administrator!"
 twrDoriotNew.6.t:0 "The Two Chefs Meet"
 twrDoriotNew.6.d:0 "Today at 6 p.m., the head of government Jacques Doriot and the head of the National Popular Rally and head of the National Revolutionary Front, Marcel Déat, meet in a Parisian restaurant. The two men know each other and hate each other. During the Occupation and the war, the two figures competed for the post of leader of the "Ultras", the name given to Parisian supporters of the German National Socialist model and of the Anti-Soviet War. After the conflict, Doriot moved away from this group to take a more "Germanosceptic" position. But now Doriot is in power, and Déat expects a place in government. The discussions took place behind closed doors, and nobody knows how the discussion went, but at the end of the evening, Déat came out looking annoyed...when suddenly, while he was preparing to return to his hotel, an unidentified man fired five shots at him. Déat died the next day at the Hôtel-Dieu Hospital. Arrests of figures from the RNP and the FNR were launched across France."
 twrDoriotNew.6.a:0 "Hmm...the meeting must have gone wrong?"
 twrDoriotNew.7.t:0 "Police Swear New Oath"
 twrDoriotNew.7.d:0 "The national police force is one of the jewels of the Marshal's Revolution, centralizing and coordinating a police force that wastoo decentralized under the Republic. This police force is one of the foundations of the French State and its effectiveness is only equaled by its loyalty. Doriot knows that the police are with him and to remind them of their duty to him, the Chef designed a new oath. \n\nAs in 1942, a new official ceremony took place for the police, during which 3,000 delegates from the Paris Guard, the National Police and the police headquarters met in the great hall of the Palais de Chaillot, under the presidency of Jean Bassompierre, new Minister of the Interior. After the band plays, the oath is taken in these terms: \n\n"I swear loyalty to the Head of State in everything he commands in the interest of service, public order, and for the good of the fatherland... I swear loyalty to the person of Chief Jacques Doriot in the interest of the new social order, the salvation of the French People's State, and of the National and Social Revolution." \n\n"To which all the police officers present respond by raising their arms and saying. "I swear.""
 twrDoriotNew.7.a:0 "Vive Darlan! Vive Doriot! Vive Bassompierre!"
 twrDoriotNew.8.t:0 "Doriot Announces the National and Popular Revolution"

The goal of the meetings were to point out the meaning of France. With our logical distance from Germany, which remains our natural enemy, we must not hide it. The concert of nations is resuming its rhythm and France must weigh with all its weight to allow the emergence of a new foreign policy, which takes its best illustration in maritime policy.

Let us remember Doriot's speeches on the Judeo-Anglo-American banks which secretly financed Gaullo-Bolshevik terrorism in France, where today he dissociated the US with the Judeo-British, in order to flatter us in joining him in getting rid of German imperialism in Europe and English colonialism in Africa.

But we are equal and must face each other with a calm mind without any chain or sword of Damocles above our heads putting one or the other in a dominant or dominated position.

Michelle frowned, she wasn't political but she wanted to listen. \n\n"And if this does not prove our own superiority to the puppets of the ancient enemy. What remains of the so-called "free" French forces have disintegrated on their own. Defeated by a racially inferior force of natives armed often with nothing but a spear and shield. In time these upstarts will also know of the new French order in Africa. France is one step closer to her national rejuvenation. We may celebrate this day my friends, but the fight against the Jew, the Bolshevik and the decadence of western democracy continues. Be wary citizens, our crusade continues" \n\nAs the chorus of Maréchal, nous voilà came to life, the room burst into song as most began celebrating the conquest of a place none of them had probably heard of before today.

On one of her walks she used to do so often, she came upon one of Doriot's little rallies, just when he and his followers were getting started. The fat, hot and sweaty man did not impress her, and she carried on. Thinking no more about him then she would an insect buzzing by her face.

Wouldn't you say so, Edmound?" \n\nJacques takes a moment to draw a cigarette and lit it. Edmound sits silently across him, considering the implied proposition. \n\n"I suppose you would be correct, but I cannot assure that all of us across the sea would agree with you immediately, Jacques. Paris has a history of distance from Algeria." \n\n"Well of course you must take this back to your people" Jacques says as he withdraws the cigarette from his mouth.

Promoting a democratic republic with strong executive powers rested in the president, the new constitution will undoubtedly be an improvement on the weak shortcomings that plagued the liberal and crypto-socialist Third Republic that brought France to ruin.

The veterans that sat before him were trained, experienced, and incredibly extreme, the last thing Darlan needed opposing his new republic. \n\nDarlan started off with flatteries, thanking the men for their service in defeating global Bolshevism. He moved onto speaking of Marechal Petain and the "founding fathers of France," a purposefully vague term to allow these men to imagine anyone they pleased in that role. Slowly, over the duration of the speech, the veterans become increasingly receptive to Darlan's words. \n\nAs the apex of his speech grew ever nearer, Darlan declared that a National Revolution had been achieved, French Republicanism had been cleansed, and that France would follow the steps of Marechal Petain into the future, free of the Reich's meddling.

Among the many reasons and benefits of the new currency will allow combating the rampant inflation, strengthening the economy and most of all will allow a greater degree of independence from the Reichsmark, this will effectively end mass scale exploitation of the French economy by German business opportunists. The French economy and businesses will have minimum German influence in them, fostering small and big businesses while also developing the economy. Already Germans have started selling off their economic interests and pulling out of their investments in France, though damaging in hindsight, complete economic independence will leave more than enough room for recovery."

In his speech, he spoke of reunification with the Free French forces in Africa, bringing an end to the separation and once again making the nation whole. President Darlan's ideas are, for the most part, simple; a total reunification of France on all levels, including government, economic, and military. \n\nFurthermore, after reunification, a series of economic projects will be pursued in the lands formerly under rule by de Gaulle's government, with the goal of furthering economic success. Beyond that, there are some political projects planned for Africa as a whole, to give tribes in the area autonomy, and sweeten the pot for continued partnership with France. \n\nThe proposal for reunification has already been sent to Dakar, and we eagerly await their response."

The proposal includes a unified government, military, and economy, as well as tribal autonomy and a series of economic projects to strengthen the French economy. However, the matter of whether to accept this or pursue our own path is a divisive issue, to say the least - not only in the French government, but within de Gaulle's own mind. \n\nSince the fall of Dunkirk, he has remained exiled in Dakar, standing strong against the French government. Darlan has long been de Gaulle's greatest rival, from the days when they were both generals under the Third Republic. But still, a unified France is something that de Gaulle has always wanted. It may be time, at last, to return to Paris, not as a victor, nor as a traitor, but as a general - the same general that fled Dunkirk in 1940. How shall we respond to Paris?"

First and foremost, we could simply accept that France shall remain split, and Dakar will remain out of our hands for the near future. Secondly, we can bring the issue to Britain, and demand that the Toronto Accord kicks out de Gaulle's forces and sanctions them.

The message, addressed to Parliament, has two demands from French President François Darlan: removal of [FFR.GetNameDef] from the Toronto Accord, and sanctions against the Free French regime. These moves are intended to put pressure on de Gaulle to agree with President Darlan's reunification plan. \n\nBoth decisions carry significant risks. If we agree and remove Free France from the Accord, it would obviously be very damaging to our relationship with Dakar, but also possibly to our other allies as well, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, who may worry that the same thing may happen to them. However, if we decline to follow through with Darlan's request, we risk damaging relations with the Accord as a whole, as well as the French government in Paris. \n\nWhat shall we do?"

Now that we have no protectors and little in the name of foreign support, there is the imminent threat of invasion from the north, as well as the possibility of collapse, with the colonies we reside in going their own way, separate from France. \n\nThe time for decision has come once again.

Now is the time for Darlan to plan his next move. \n\nThree options now lie before us: first, we can mobilise our forces for an invasion of [FFR.GetNameDef], declaring a crusade against the Toronto Accord in Africa. However, it must be noted that this would be a nuclear option, and a very dangerous one at that. \n\nSecond, we can break off our close ties with the Accord, declaring them traitors and backstabbers that care little for France. This would, obviously, harm our ties with the Accord, and lead to a loss of diplomatic options. \n\nFinally, we can just accept that the de Gaulle will remain in the Toronto Accord, split from the rightful French government. This would be the safe option, maintaining our close ties with the Accord, but some would likely see it as caving to foreign influence. What shall the choice be?"

Darlan has conceded defeat, and sent a congratulatory phone call to now-President Noguès. \n\nThe chosen successor of the dearly-departed Maréchal Weygand, Général Noguès chose to honour both the former Chief of State and his predecessor, Maréchal Pétain, saying in his hour-long victory speech that, "their struggle to create a Christian, conservative France shall continue with me at the helm." Afterwards, he toured through parts of Paris, greeting crowds of supporters celebrating his victory throughout the city, before retiring to his home for rest. \n\nGénéral Noguès is a man who has served in many positions over many years. He fought in the First World War, as well as the Rif War, served in the cabinets of Millerand during the Third Republic and Weygand before his assumption of the highest office himself. He served in North Africa under Maréchal Lyautey, as well as serving as Résident Général in his own right before and during the Second World War.

He asked the citizens to return to the plan Petain had set for France. The address' aftereffects were widespread, with a renewed wave of Petainism among the citizens of France."

The accompanying horrors would have never been if it hadn't been for our complicity. \n\nThe time is at hand to set things right. We cannot abide with this current state of affairs. If France is to be strong again, it needs to reconnect with its past. Petain envisioned a society in which the traditions of the past would be held in the esteem they deserve.

 #Leaders
 TWR_Jacques_Duclos:0 "Born on the 2nd of October, 1896 in Louey, Jacques Duclos was a patissier from the south of France. A soldier in the Great War, he was captured and became a POW in 1917. Joining the PCF at its foundation, he rose rapidly within the party hierarchy, becoming Deputy in 1928, and defeating the socialist leader Léon Blum. \n\nIn charge of the internal discipline of the PCF, the invasion of France by the Third Reich propelled Duclos to the head of the organization in the absence of Maurice Thorez and the other party leaders. Having reorganised the party, he ensured its domination in the communist resistance forces and in one of the most important political organizations of the resistance, the National Front of Struggle for the Liberation and Independence of France. \n\nNow Jacques Duclos is one of the chief figures of the resistance and one of the most  wanted men by the French State and the Third Reich."
 TWR_Charles_Tillon:0 "Charles Tillion was born on the 3rd of July, 1897 in Rennes. During the start of the Great War, Charles Tillon was employed as a worker in the naval yards. Recruited as a mechanic during the war, he led a mutiny on the cruiser Guichen in 1919 during the Black Sea Mutinies, to protest against the harshness of the French fleet command. Joining the PCF in 1921, he became a leading figure of the workers in the fishing industry during the numerous strikes in the west of Brittany. In 1932 he entered the PCF Central Committee and was appointed as a substitute of the Political Bureau; in 1936, he was elected as deputy of Aubervilliers. \n\nResponsible for repatriating Spanish Republican fighters in 1939, he was elected as deputy of the PCF in 1940. At the declaration of the capitulation of France by Pétain in June 1940, Tillon responded by calling for immediate popular resistance. Reconstructing the underground PCF, he took the lead of the Franc-tireurs et Partisans and coordinated the actions of the FTP with non-communist resistance organizations. \n\nThe organizational head of the FTP-MOI, Charles Tillon is perceived as the second in command of the Communist Front's resistance."
 TWR_Emmanuel_Vigerie:0 "Born on January 6th, 1900 in Paris, Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie was descended from a line of ennobled barons under the July Monarchy. He was a member of 'Action Française' in his youth and entered the Naval Academy in 1919, though soon resigned from the Navy in 1924 and began a career as a journalist, reporting from Germany, Spain and the United States. \n\nRe-enlisting in August 1939 to fight the Germans, he was demobilized in Marseille in July 1940 following the defeat of the French Army. In reaction to the Vichy regime he began into resistance action and co-founded the "Libération-Sud" movement with Jean Cavaillès at a Clermont-Ferrand cafe in June 1941. This network would become, with "Combat" and "Franc-Tireur", one of the three most important resistance movements in the southern regions. Libération was nominally leftist, recruiting its members from reformist and socialist union circles. Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie was charged by General De Gaulle to unify the non-communist elements of the resistance movement through the Free French Resistance Movement, which coordinated actions with the FTP and FNLF. \n\nDespite his royalist past de La Vigerie is known for his connections with the political left. This attracts both enmities with leading members of the RFL and the sympathy of the FNLF. De La Vigerie is also known as the author of the French Resistance anthem; 'Le Chant des Partisans'."
 TWR_Guy_Mollet:0 "Born on December 31st 1905 in Flers, Guy Mollet joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) as a young man in 1923. He became an English teacher and was transferred to Arras in northern France. By 1928 he had become assistant secretary of the Jeunesses socialistes (Youth Socialists) in Pas-de-Calais. \n\nMobilized into the French Army in 1940, he was taken prisoner but soon released in June 1941. Mollet joined the Resistance within the Civil and Military Organization (CMO) a few months later, which brought together resistance fighters of all tendencies, from the radical leftists to anti-collaborationist conservatives, though socialists were predominant. After strenuous negotiations he eventually joined with the Communist-led FNLLIF which sought to unite working class resistance forces. \n\nGuy Mollet has long represented the leftist fringe of the clandestine SFIO, which seeks proximity to the Communists, often counter to rest of the SFIO, aligned to the RFL."
