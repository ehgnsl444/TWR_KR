twrTransvolgaNew.1001.t:0 "An Offer from Bulgarin"
twrTransvolgaNew.1001.d:0 "The repurposed bomber barely makes it to Uralsk in one piece - by some stroke of fate the anti-aircraft emplacements do not detect it until it is almost upon the runway, and by then it is far too late to dispose of the little craft safely. The juddering bulk, shedding smoke from its turboprops, spits out several disheveled men and women before falling silent. They are received by unamused local police, divested of their weapons, and delivered unto the nearest local prison with as much grace as the authorities can muster. \n\nInitial investigations into the identity of the newest wave of refugees prove futile - a police colonel snarls at the assembled party in frustration to drop the pretence. Nikolai Bulganin is a high-ranking member of the Soviet Politburo, and his family and close friends are equally distant from the Republic. Their crude attempts to assume his identity are not doing themselves any favours - why, don't they know that the Republic is staffed by officers who hate the Union as much as any German? \n\nThe grey-haired man opposite him sighs, retrieves a wallet from his waistcoat. A badge is unceremoniously dropped at the Colonel - as the Colonel reads it, his eyes go wide. The Politburo Badge, even after all these years, is as polished as any boot in the Republic, and shinier to boot. It is of the highest rank, and atop it is a name, NIKOLAI ALEXANDROVICH BULGANIN. \n\nThe man kneads at his temples, visibly weary. He has little time, he murmurs, and so much to do in it. Leaning forward, he whispers, "Take me to your leadership. My home is in trouble - the madman of the NKVD run it now - and only you can save us." "
twrTransvolgaNew.1001.a:0 "Only you can save Russia."
twrTransvolgaNew.0.t:0 "A Proposal from Bagramyan"
twrTransvolgaNew.0.d:0 "Idel-Ural and Transvolga have not had the best of relations, historically speaking: their shared border and mutual security issues have only worsened inherent tensions between the two states. Only the threat of German invasion has kept border disputes from escalating to full-scale clashes - that, and the convoys of trade moving between the two capitals. Money, after all, has always spoken in louder tones than aggression ever could. \n\nThe motorised convoys appearing in Kazan this week appear no different from the ones that were here last month, nor the month before that. Non-descript, repurposed military hardware, and with the irritatingly bright colors of the Transvolgan flag plastered on their sides. The soldiers sent to escort the convoy into the capital make the usual bawdy jokes as they march past the city gate - the trade convoy is such a common occurrence that the garrison dispenses with the usual vehicular searches, a rare but understandable choice. \n\nThe revelation that the convoy's contents are not those of equipment or agricultural imports, but armed men, causes quite the stir, to understate things. Small-arms fire nearly kills the Diplomatic Representative as several trigger-happy guards lose their grip on the situation, before the harried Sadri Maksudi Arsa himself appears to calm the guards down and to formally welcome the former into the Capital. \n\nThe proposal the Representative has is simple: in the face of mounting Soviet pressures, the Transvolgan Republic has reassessed its strategic priorities. The truth is that despite a history of poor relations, Idel-Ural remains a necessary ally in the struggle against the Bolshevik threat and the German menace. In this light, an alliance is not just preferable - it is inevitable."
twrTransvolgaNew.0.a:0 "We must unite in the face of Bolshevism!"
twrTransvolgaNew.0.b:0 "Our sovereignty is more valuable than words of the Transvolgans."
twrTransvolgaNew.1.t:0 "Idel Ural Accepts"
twrTransvolgaNew.1.d:0 "Delegates from Idel-Ural arrived recently with joyous news; their government will comply with our ultimatum. Despite some initial uncertainty over their potential lack of interest, it turns out they're more than happy to unite with us. The delegates stated that it would be easier to defend Tatar land from German and Soviet domination if we joined forces. Per their wishes, we'll ensure that the local Tatar governments maintain a degree of autonomy under Transvolgan rule. \n\nWith the impending annexation, the Idel-Ural government will forgo their relations with the German Reich. Some in our administration have raised concerns about the Tatars' previous collaboration with the Nazis, but that will have to be set aside in the interest of fostering national unity."
twrTransvolgaNew.1.a:0 "The Caucasus stands united!"
twrTransvolgaNew.2.t:0 "Idel Ural Declines"
twrTransvolgaNew.2.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Idel-Ural with terrible and outrageous news: the Tatar government turned us down. The president flatly rejected our offer to incorporate their state into our own. We've been too kind to these craven collaborators. They don't deserve even a fraction of the generosity we've shown them. Because they've refused to go along with our wishes, we will have to employ force to make them fall in line. \n\nOur top-ranking military personnel are fully in favor of a military intervention, although there's considerable disagreement over when and how to go about it. General Nurmagambetov is insistent that we should stage a military invasion at once. He feels that the Tatar government needs to annihilated as soon as possible for working with the the hated Nazi invaders. Alternatively, we could bide our time and intervene at a later date. General Baklanov has urged us to wait until later so we can more carefully plan our invasion."
twrTransvolgaNew.2.a:0 "To arms! There will be no mercy for those who consort with fascists."
twrTransvolgaNew.2.b:0 "They'll get what's coming to them someday, but not today."
twrTransvolgaNew.3.t:0 "Soldiers Mutiny to Transvolga!"
twrTransvolgaNew.3.d:0 "Ivanov is already up when the dawn comes for the border garrison, tending to his little gathering of wildlife - it cost a month of pay to keep the political officers off his neck for developing 'private industry' - and that's where he is when the Commissar finds him. Ivanov makes no move to salute, merely standing to welcome him with the usual taciturn nod. \n\nThe Commissar stands, unsmiling. There are many things that could be said about this breach of regulations, to him and to the men he must answer to. The shadow of distant knives is surely not far from Ivanov's back. But there are greater things than his little breach to discuss today, and he lets the matter drop. \n\n"Ivanov. What do you know about your commander? Andreevich, that's his name. Have you heard rumors about his, ah, indiscretions?" Ivanov merely glares at the Commissar, unyielding. The Commissar sighs. It's time to offer the carrot to the hidden stick. \n\n"I'm asking because I need to know - and the Union needs to know, too. Listen, you know the new Premier is in power now. The NKVD is the friend of the people, even if they don't know it, but with our big job comes big responsibilities. And I want to carry out this responsibility in this regiment, so close to the reactionary forces. We have to be loyal to the State, Ivanov." \n\nThe Commissar waves at the makeshift garden. "I'll make sure this discretion gets overlooked, but in turn you must help me keep an eye out for Commandeer Andreevich. There are big things ahead of us, boy. I want you and I to be on the same side when those things come. Or-" \n\nHe barely hears the gunshot as the Tokarev takes off the top of his head. Commander Andreevich's hand trembles as the pistol is lowered. He takes a deep breath, looks at Ivanov and says, in a breathy whisper..."
twrTransvolgaNew.3.a:0 "Pack your things and head for Uralsk. Now."
twrTransvolgaNew.4.t:0 "Bring An End to the Admiral"
twrTransvolgaNew.4.d:0 "Transvolga trembles. There is a storm brewing, and everyone can see it, in the slow move of conscript divisions to the border with the Soviets, in the tightened rations, in the slow closure of markets in Uralsk. The beast slouches towards Uralsk, ready to be born. \n\nIn Uralsk itself there is a deceptive calm. The Government's declaration of martial law has been received uneventfully, and there is little that has changed apart from the patrols increasing slightly in frequency on the city streets. Old generals from the Soviet era sit in darkened hallways, whispering of plans and strategies excavated from the foundation of the Republic itself. Military vans move about the city in erratic fashion, going this way and that, and their contents - or purpose - are unknown even by the Generals themselves. \n\nThe Junta faces a choice: the Soviet brigades, from the reports of defectors, are themselves in disarray as the Union chokes on its own blood. They will pose no initial resistance if an invasion is mounted immediately - but if their weakened states prove sufficient to withstand Transvolgan arms, the Republic's own supply chains are in danger of collapsing. On the other hand, to wait could mean a final closing of the window that has opened before them - if the Soviet brigades might be difficult to overcome now, what happens when the NKVD finishes turning them into effective battlefield units? \n\nThere is a storm brewing, and the Uralsk weathervane tips and sways in the violent wind. A choice must be made, and the Republic's fate decided - or the choice will be taken out of its hands."
twrTransvolgaNew.4.a:0 "We strike now."
twrTransvolgaNew.4.b:0 "Delay a little."
twrTransvolgaNew.5.t:0 "The Surrender of the Soviets"
twrTransvolgaNew.5.d:0 "The once great city of Perm, while finally captured, is but a shell of its former self. Fires rage across apartment complexes, and looting is commonplace. As detachments of our occupying forces move in to restore order, the sounds of firing squads executing criminals and communist party politicians are heard all through the night. As our troops break into the central committee hall to arrest the Soviet leadership, they came across a most grizzly scene. The great Kuzentsov dangles from a noose hanging from the ceiling. Cutting his lifeless corpse down, they find his neck to be heavily bruised, suggesting a botched suicide that took him a couple minutes to die.\n\nWith our high command entering the building of horrors to formally sign off on the Soviet capitulation, the same story is found in most offices and hallways. Some chose to take their own life with a bullet, others chose cyanide capsules. Finally coming across some remaining generals busy burning old papers, the terms for surrender were agreed upon. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics no longer exists. the state of Transvolga will formally annex its former territory as the legitimate successor state. As the final signatures are written, Kuzentsov's body and the rest of the Politburo are driven to a small forest canopy and are set alight with canisters of gasoline."
twrTransvolgaNew.5.a:0 "After three decades, the Soviet experiment has finally come to an end."
twrTransvolgaNew.6.t:0 "The New Russian Union"
twrTransvolgaNew.6.d:0 "Many thought this day was unthinkable, but it has arrived all the same. The USSR has fallen to the Caucasian warlord state of Transvolga. The Red Army had the numerical advantage but they were no match for our superior training and discipline. Although the conquests are over, the battle to reclaim Russia has only just begun. We will rebuild this broken country with our military rigor and work ethic. To aid with reconciliation, we've begun to reintegrate trustworthy Soviet officers and commanders into our armed forces. \n\nThe black banner of Bagramyan and his crack team of generals now flies over every major city across the former Bolshevik empire. But atop the White House in Moscow, a new tricolor is being hoisted up the flagpole. It represents a new nation born from the strife and disorder of the Nazi invasion. Under its dutiful gaze, Russia shall become stronger than it ever was before. No dastardly fascists of the world will never even dare to think about pushing us around again. We have brought the people of the Caucasus and Russia together in a union state of our design, the New Russian Union."
twrTransvolgaNew.6.a:0 "Long live Russia, a free country!"
twrTransvolgaNew.7.t:0 "The Russians Demand Karelia"
twrTransvolgaNew.7.d:0 "We recently received a letter from the government of the New Russian Union, which has so far caused nothing but trouble for our government. In it, written in harsh and violent wording, the Junta of the New Russian Union demands the return of the Karelia to them as it is their own rightful land. The letter ended with the threat of "immediate action" if we fail to comply with their demands. \n\nOn one hand, by giving away Karelia, we will be throwing out to the trash the years and men lost fighting against the Soviets during the Winter and Continuation War while also shooting ourselves in the leg when it comes to national cohesion. But in the other hand, if we don't comply to the Russian demands, we might have to face a far bigger threat which may not shoot us in the leg, but instead in the head and far worse. \n\nThus, we must decide between our nations pride or its survival."
twrTransvolgaNew.7.a:0 "Let them have Karelia, its been nothing but problematic since we received it."
twrTransvolgaNew.7.b:0 "We beat them once, we will beat them once more for Suomi!"
twrTransvolgaNew.8.t:0 "Finland Cedes Karelia to Us"
twrTransvolgaNew.8.d:0 "Early in the hours of the morning, we received word from our diplomats in Finland that the Finnish government has agreed to our demands for Karelia. Trucks of Finnish soldiers begun to be transported, fences and checkpoints teared down and the flag of the New Russian Union flew high above our rightful lands."
twrTransvolgaNew.8.a:0 "Not so tough without your allies it seems."
twrTransvolgaNew.9.t:0 "Finland Rejects our Demands"
twrTransvolgaNew.9.d:0 "We received a letter in the late hours of the evening from the Finnish government, denying our demands over Karelia. In their letter, they denied all our demands, citing Karelia as historically Finnish land where no Russian boot will ever step again. \n\nThe damned Finns have the audacity to block our path towards Russian unification. We will not stand for such insolence!"
twrTransvolgaNew.9.a:0 "Tear down the Finnish border with the dead bodies of their soldiers immediatelly!"
twrTransvolgaNew.9.b:0 "We must use this time to prepare even better to face the Finns."
twrTransvolgaNew.10.t:0 "Death of Bagramyan"
twrTransvolgaNew.10.d:0 "Altunin watches the Orthodox priest whisper the last rites over a silent and shallow-breathing Bagramyan. In truth no one in the Junta had any idea as to Bagramyan's personal faith. Certainly he was never a church-goer or a fervent Muslim, and if the village of his birth christened him into a non-Abrahamic faith, the Generals never caught wind. This hasty ceremony is the best they can do for one of their number, with their limited resources and on a timeline. \n\nUralsk is unlikely to care either way - their attention will be on what comes next, and already Altunin is rehearsing his acceptance speech. The decision was made in the first hours after the announcement of the aneurysm, an attempt to safeguard against popular unrest. Altunin does not have the baggage of the rest of the old guard, and he is not a figure the Unions of Uralsk outright despise. There is an opportunity to deliver Transvolga from the horror of popular revolt, and perhaps to build a common home, just as Bagramyan had once dreamed before chaos embittered him. \n\nAltunin can only hope he is prescient - and bold - enough to seize it. \n\nThe body chokes, splutters, rattles - and is silent. Altunin salutes, stiffly, and walks out to address the crowd as the wails grow behind him. As Bagramyan's loved ones mourn, his nation hangs on what he has to say next. \n\nThe journalists wait outside that little chapel, already jostling for attention. Altunin sighs, wipes his brow and doffs his cap. "Citizens, Transvolga mourns. Our comrade and protector is dead - but our nation is not. And as interim President, I have changes to announce...""
twrTransvolgaNew.10.a:0 "We will build a home, here, together. This I promise."
