BRY_no_nobles:0 "Future of the Garrison"
BRY_no_nobles_desc:0 "As the year of 1952 dawns, the fires of the Great Patriotic War have all but died down, even the embers are all but snuffed out. Alas a quiet darkness has fallen over Russia lasting some years now and perhaps many years to come. Things have been equally quiet in the Siberian wastes, with no enemy activity or things to do thanks to the lack of infrastructure and orders from Vladivostok the american GIs have grown restless and bored. \n\nRepetition breeds contempt after all and so does it in the populace, with tensions rising perhaps it is time for a change in scenery?"
BRY_find_nobles:0 "Extending the Occupation"
BRY_find_nobles_desc:0 "Despite our soldiers wishes the statelet of Buryatia is far too unstable and the peace that between the warlords is as fragile as the first snow of the year and the order we have established more brittle than a veteran boxers set of teeth. \n\nThe US occupation must continue for the time being, perhaps even till Russia is united once more."
BRY_tsarists:0 "Reinforcing the Garrisons"
BRY_tsarists_desc:0 "The US garrisons are of vital importance for the defense of the Buryat territory, providing supply, shelter and scouts for our troops both foreign and native. With the ample supply of arms from the States these garrisons can be finally built up into the strongholds they deserve to be."
BRY_cossacks:0 "Bringer of Stability"
BRY_cossacks_desc:0 "With the Siberian War destabilizing the Russian Republic, the USFB has ironically become one of the saver havens in the areas controlled by the free world. And we are determined to keep it that way. Buryatia shall be a shining beacon of stability and perhaps one day prosperity, shining the light of America onto these lands."
BRY_crown_officers:0 "Training Our Officers"
BRY_crown_officers_desc:0 "Soldiers are like their guns, if they are not maintained properly they grow decrepit. Even with wars only flicker on the horizon we can not allow ourselves to gather too much rest, no matter how much the dullness of the wastes amplifies that. With some of our men growing old a new generation must arise with which we shall one day conquer the wastes!"
BRY_wheres_palace:0 "The Reconstruction Scheme"
BRY_wheres_palace_desc:0 "Russia despite the bolsheviks efforts still limps behind most of the civilized world in industrial and agricultural capacity and the Great Patriotic War has done much to undo even that effort. Much of the industry has been either left to rot, looted or does no longer have those knowledgeable how to operate their machinery. It is time to change that."
BRY_build_palace:0 "Empower Local Industries"
BRY_build_palace_desc:0 "Industrial strength can not just be forced onto by the outside, we must cultivate an entrepreneurial and innovative spirit among the russian populace itself. Restrictions on local businesses and firms shall be lifted and the people given the opportunity to work for themselves once more."
BRY_palace_guards:0 "American Supplies"
BRY_palace_guards_desc:0 "Beyond the Pacific lies the greatest country on earth, both politically and economy. With a myriad of the finest goods and weapons on the planet. These goods have long elevated Buryatia despite our small numbers beyond the other warlords of Russia and they shall do so for many years to come."
BRY_dont_find_nobles:0 "We Are Pulling Out!"
BRY_dont_find_nobles_desc:0 "For too long have our boys banged their heads against the walls of their barracks to at least feel something apart from boredom. With things all quiet on the eastern front General Cronkhite has decided to pull the bulk of our forces out, replacing them with russian officials and soldiers. Whilst unpopular with Vladivostok it's not like they can do much about it."
BRY_rulings_hard:0 "Increasing Russian Influence"
BRY_rulings_hard_desc:0 "The first step in our orderly retreat is to empower more russian officials and officers, responsibilities will be shifted to natives of the Buryat and the Republic, making sure that no bureaucratic instability opens us up to attacks from the neighboring warlords."
BRY_get_help:0 "Begin the Withdrawal"
BRY_get_help_desc:0 "With the paperwork done, the second step is to start the withdrawal in earnest. While a raffle will decide the portion of the poor devils that need to man the leftover posts we won't abandon the majority of our men rejoice as they can go grab their girlfriends and surfboards and stop for a nice pitstop in Hawaii."
BRY_book_people:0 "Building a Local Security Force"
BRY_book_people_desc:0 "Peace as every man knows does not last forever and despite our boredom the Buryat still serves as an important stronghold against the warlords of Siberia. The final step of our withdrawal will be filling the gaps we left with loyal, local men that shall defend their motherland in earnest and without screaming in their pillows every night from homesickness."
BRY_throw_party:0 "A Russo-American Agreement"
BRY_throw_party_desc:0 "With the future of the garrison decided, it is time to re-approach the russians and put the change in course onto paper with ink. Buryatia stands strong and shall do so until the accursed Bolsheviks are butchered to the last man!"

BRY_party_supplies:0 "The Irkutsk Incident"
BRY_party_supplies_desc:0 "After years of uneasy peace with explosions of violence thrown in for good measure, the Irkutsk Incident has pushed the situation over the edge. As thousands protest the US administration and the GI's needing to desert many outposts and checkpoints for fear of their life the fate of the special administrative zone hangs in the balance..."
BRY_party_food:0 "America's Grip"
BRY_party_food_desc:0 "With the despicable VNS defeated and the people of Buryat made to understand the continued administration by US forces, we stand firm but in a difficult predicament. The status quo has become unacceptable and more importantly unsustainable. \n\nIf we hope to retain any US influence in the region we must act quickly and prudently, lest another troope of drunkard idiots almost torch the nation."
BRY_party_food_animals:0 "Indoctrination by Food"
BRY_party_food_animals_desc:0 "The central russian famine has wracked the region for years, snuffing out thousands of lives and jeopardizing perhaps millions more - and thanks to Russia's agricultural predicament worse yet a thing not only of the present but the future. However chaos, it seems, is also a ladder and with the almost infinite supply of food we can request from the US, Buryat might soon turn into the beacon of hope for the russian peoples it was always meant to be."
BRY_party_food_fruits_and_cheese:0 "Lessening Restrictions on G.I.s"
BRY_party_food_fruits_and_cheese_desc:0 "In the rest of the world such appalling behavior as in the Irkutsk incident by our soldiers would being court martialed on the spot and their entire battalion punished, but Siberia is not like the rest of the world. Ironically the obscene behavior these soldiers displayed may be best reigned in by giving our soldiers a reason not to drink in excess, instead lifting some of the heaviest restrictions will hopefully give our men the morale boost they need to not loose their grip in the russian wastes."
BRY_party_food_storage:0 "Operation Siberian Freedom"
BRY_party_food_storage_desc:0 "With the USFB stabilized and our men forged into the liberators Siberia deserves, it is time to decide rather the operation is completed or not."
BRY_party_drink:0 "Returning to Russia"
BRY_party_drink_desc:0 "With the GIs misdeeds having forever lost the trust of the Buryat people, General Cronkhite saw prudent to at last truly bring our boys home. The United States Forces in Buryat will relinquish all control of the area to the jurisdiction in Vladivostok in the hopes that the Russians will be able to appease their own kin in ways foreigners never could hope to."
BRY_party_drink_french_champagne:0 "Employment Opportunities for Locals"
BRY_party_drink_french_champagne_desc:0 "The american garrison whilst small compared to the number of locals still has ample need for outside assistance. Be it manning the american runways, arms factories or supplies lines there are ample employment opportunities for the locals. Besides the obvious logistic advantage this may also these strangers from a strange land that we without a doubt are in the minds of the locals more tangible and perhaps even amicable to them."
BRY_party_drink_finnish_champagne:0 "Tyrants into Lake Baikal"
BRY_party_drink_finnish_champagne_desc:0 "Lake Baikal is considered not only the worlds deepest at approximately 745m and the oldest at approximately 25 million years. In that endless abyss of the ancient world we shall hurl all the tyrants that did not escape our grasp when we threw the foreign shackles off, and all that will not escape us in the future as we free all of the russian wastes."
BRY_party_entertainment:0 "An Enigma Rises..."
BRY_party_entertainment_desc:0 "In the heart of Russia an enigma rises. Freed from the shackles of bolshevism and capitalism. Standing alone in a sea of the old, a new order rises. Never again shall the russians be shackled, never again shall the russians be ruled by tyrants, never again will the russians have to suffer the outsider."
BRY_party_entertainment_american:0 "American Weapon Caches"
BRY_party_entertainment_american_desc:0 "The yanks leaving in a hurry have left quite the selection of goods in our lands. While the irony of using the cock of the rifle that beat us for so long ourselves is lost on none their ability to strike down the enemies of the people is unmatched in the russian wastes. Such a technological edge shall be most useful once we burn the tyrants of Russia to ashes!"
BRY_party_entertainment_italian:0 "Establish Ethnic Communes"
BRY_party_entertainment_italian_desc:0 "For millennia the people of the world toiled happily in their fields, mines and homes. Amongst their own kin, free from the poison of commerce they found true happiness. Yet with the arrival of the modern age, the foreign hordes and the almighty dollar the people became collared, shackled to false idols and ideas that went against their very livelihood. \n\nNow the people have stood up and stand once more free and proud, alone."
BRY_party_entertainment_monitoring:0 "For a Stateless Fatherland!"
BRY_party_entertainment_monitoring_desc:0 "The idea of a truly free man has only surfaced for a brief glimpse in modern times, in the streets of Paris, in the dust of the Spanish civil war and finally in distant Ukraine. Their efforts quickly crushed by Bourgeois and Bolshevik hand. We shall never let this come to pass again, we shall rage against the enemies on all sites till no state, no tyrant only the spirit of the fatherland remains."
BRY_party_guest_list:0 "Our Might is Unstoppable!"
BRY_party_guest_list_desc:0 "We are the liberators of Russia! The warlords fear us, the Bolsheviks dread the day we stand at their doorstep and the Republic grows uneasy at the sight of the might of our horde! \n\nWe shall rampage through the russian wastes and in every liberated town and hamlet we shall raise our banners for the world to see, Here be freedom!"
BRY_party_guest_list_neighbors:0 "Post-Struggle Non-Nation States"
BRY_party_guest_list_neighbors_desc:0 "In the midst of Russia, a new order rises a union not of soviets, republics or whatever honey the tyrants coat their leashes in. A confederation of equal ethnic communes where every russian man, woman and child may live their life to the fullest. With the liberated Buryat as our stronghold we shall unshackle the other warlords till the Republic and Union have in their midst a formidable enemy that shall end them all the same."
BRY_party_guest_list_strangers:0 "An American Bulwark Against Bolshevism"
BRY_party_guest_list_strangers_desc:0 "In the midst of Russia a trench rises, manned by the patriots of Russia and America, wielding the finest weapons of both. All united in a singular purpose: stamping out the Red Menace forever. We shall be the first line of defense, the first bulwark, against the red tide. The Reds will break their men on our walls again and again till they are weak and exhausted and then the true Republic shall venture forth and end them at last."
BRY_party_final_prep:0 "Cementing Our Legacy!"
BRY_party_final_prep_desc:0 "With our enemies both within and without crushed by the might of military, a moment of respite has come. We stand alone in the siberian wastes, to our left the Soviets to our right the Republic. With both eyeing us anxiously it is time to go out with a bang and leave one last mark on the region!"
BRY_wrap_it_up:0 "Wrap it Up!"
BRY_wrap_it_up_desc:0 "With Operation Siberian Freedom over for better or worse, it is time to again look inwards and leave our mark on the region so that the eventual transfer of power to the Republic goes smoothly and the statelet is well guarded against the horrors beyond the border."
BRY_building_an_independent_buryatia:0 "Building a Nation"
BRY_building_an_independent_buryatia_desc:0 "Before Russia is reunited once more and the Bolshevik forever vanquished perhaps decades more will pass, the future remains uncertain. In the meantime we must build up the Buryat Republic as its own largely autonomous bulwark against the pretenders to the russian throne. Only that way can the security and stability of the region be guaranteed."
BRY_authority_to_russia:0 "Russian Authority"
BRY_authority_to_russia_desc:0 "The Irkutsk Incident has shown that the russians won't let themselves by ruled by none but their own. We must begin to prematurely build up the structures that are supposed to govern Buryat for preferably decades to come, as a federal subject of the Russian Republic."

twrburyatia.1.t:0 "Future of the USFB!"
###Someone change those 
twrburyatia.1.d:0 "Following the American intervention in the Russian Far East and the creation of the American-aligned Russian Republic, most forces had been withdraw to enjoy the end of the Pacific War at home. Most, but not all. A small number of specialist forces were sent to bolster the White Russian forces in the lake Baikal region, forming the US Forces in Buryatia expeditionary force. Fighting various regional warlords, the force has now been on deployment for over five years and now sees little fighting. Of course, the effects on the force's morale of being stationed in the wasteland of Siberia to do nothing is immense, but they had been kept there on the insistance of Vladivostok. Now, though, things have come to a head, with a big push both in the United States and among the men in Buryatia to bring the last of the soldiers home."
twrburyatia.1.a:0 "They can't come home yet"
twrburyatia.1.b:0 "Their mission is over"
#twrburyatia.2.t:0 "Food for the Party"
#twrburyatia.2.d:0 "Every proper party by royalty has a vast banquet of food from all over the world. Our party must have the same status! But the...conditions of our location don't allow us for many options. So we have two options! \n\nOur first option to go for fish, a good treat and hell, maybe we may find some caviar along the way. Our other option is to delve into the marvelous world of cheese! So many kinds and choices will show our guests that we are sophisticated like the monarchs in France! \n\nTheres still monarchs in France, right?"
#twrburyatia.2.a:0 "Fish is on the Menu!"
#twrburyatia.2.b:0 "Cheese is on the Menu!"
twrburyatia.3.t:0 "Operation Siberian Freedom"
twrburyatia.3.d:0 "With the USFB stabilized and our men forged into the liberators Siberia deserves, it is time to once more look outwards. Beyond the borders of the Buryat and the Republic lie the warlords of the wastes and beyond that the accursed red star. \n\nWhile a group seeks to wrap up the current operations, some think that the US' task in Siberia has yet to be completed.\n\nIs Operation Siberian Freedom completed? Is it really time for the Americans to go home? These are the questions flowing inside the heads of the local command, which have been given almost full authority to decide for this little occupational government."
twrburyatia.3.a:0 "It's time to go home."
twrburyatia.3.b:0 "We ought to liberate more!"
#twrburyatia.4.t:0 "Drinks for the Party"
#twrburyatia.4.d:0 "From ancient times, parties were places where guests drunk alchoholic beverages. This party will be the same! As in accordance with our great duchy, we must have the drink of Kings, champagne! But the problem lies wether we want actual Champagne from the region of Champagne in France, or just Sparkling Wine from Finland."
#twrburyatia.4.a:0 "Only the best for my guests!"
#twrburyatia.4.b:0 "Finnish Champagne arrives quicker."
twrburyatia.5.t:0 "Entertainment for the Party"
twrburyatia.5.d:0 "In every successful party, theres always some sort of entertainment in order keep the guests busy and occupied. If not, then it will be one very boring party. Afterall, you can chatter so much before you run out of saliva. Thus, we must look towards the outside for entertainment. In the East we got the Yanks and their fancy musicians and all that. In the West, we have the Italians and their...circuses? \n\nDoes anyone know what Italy is famous for?"
twrburyatia.5.a:0 "Some American Musicians won't hurt."
twrburyatia.5.b:0 "I guess the Italians will have something to offer."
twrburyatia.6.t:0 "Subversives Among Us"
twrburyatia.6.d:0 "As we prepare to the entertainment for our party, we have been informed that there are individuals among us that wish to disrupt our party. We are not sure exactly who those may be but many suspect the men in red from the South. We ought to take over and make sure they don't ruin our plans for the great party."
twrburyatia.6.a:0 "The quicker we intervene, the less chances they will ruin the party!"
twrburyatia.6.b:0 "We can take care of them later."
twrburyatia.7.t:0 "Who should we invite?"
twrburyatia.7.d:0 "We have finally prepared everything we need so we can host our party. But we need one last thing, guests! Now, we have to options really on who to invite. One is for kind neighbours in the East, the White Russians, we have met before and talked to so they will probably like us. The other option is to invite guests from the Western nations, like the USA, the UK and many others. \n\nBut the point still stands, the more guests, the better!"
twrburyatia.7.a:0 "Lets invite our neighbours!"
twrburyatia.7.b:0 "We should make some new friends!"
twrburyatia.8.t:0 "Our Last Step to Greatness"
twrburyatia.8.d:0 "The sounds of boots marching and trumpets blowing can be heard from all over the tundra- Buryatia stands triumphant, at last as a true force of might, finally victorious over its petty rivals ! Through cunning planning, fierce determination and the courage of the Buryatian people, we have conquered the entirety of Central Siberia, integrating it into our proud nation. No one can deny, even our enemies, that we are a true force to be wrecking with and what remains of those who stand against us should fear us! \n\nNow however, we are met with our grandest challenge so far. We arent the greatest russian state. In fact, we are the only one. To establish the final stone of our legacy, our last step on the path to greatness, we must choose who we should take out once and for all. \n\nWe can march west, to Omsk and Perm, and storm the remainders of The Red Army, annihilate the NKVD and finally end the worker's delusion of relevance and power! We can also march east, to Vladivostok, and conquer the weak Russian Republic, taking their lands for ourselves and establishing an eternal legacy over Siberia!"
twrburyatia.8.a:0 "Down with the Bolsheviks!"
twrburyatia.8.b:0 "Down with the Russian Republicans!"
twrburyatia.9.t:0 "A Buryatian Republic"
twrburyatia.9.d:0 "As American forces withdraw, the de facto rulers of the Buryatia territory disappears, leaving behing a mostly desolate, but not uninhabited, land. With responsibility to rule themselves being passed back to the inhabitants of the region, a new state, a Buryatian Republic, rises."
twrburyatia.9.a:0 "A new state!"
twrburyatia.10.t:0 "The Irkutsk Incident"
twrburyatia.10.d:0 "As the sun dawned on the Great Baikal and rose over the tundra, Buryatia was woken up by turmoil. Huge masses of people by the thousands marched on the streets, waving flags and signs, shouting for change, for a new future. Their demands are for the American marines to finally leave their home, so a true and legitimate government can take their place. There has always been heavy disapproval of our rule over Buryatia, but never on such a scale, never so fierce. \n\nThe protests were the biggest and most violent in Irkutsk, the city on the Baikal, and our capital, where protesters  threw rocks and tried to overwhelm our forces. In one case, later nicknamed the \"Irkutsk Incident\", a few soldiers were brought down by several angry protesters, leading to the other marines dispersing the crowd with warning shots and physical violence. Several people, including 7 protesters and 1 marine have been rushed to the hospital, all currently in serious condition. After the incident protests have only grown, leading to shops and buildings have been looted and the situation growing evermore tireless. \n\nWe fear that if we don't take action soon, we might not even have the chance to do so later on. We must make an important choice now. We can stay and solidify our rule on Buryatia with harsh crackdowns on protests and enforcing of our authority in the cities. We can, however, decide to leave, but make sure the region transitions to the Russian Republic and a safe order of democracy is established, or alternatively, just leave the region to its own devices."
twrburyatia.10.a:0 "We are in charge here, not some angry mobs!"
twrburyatia.10.b:0 "Let's make sure The Russian Republic safely annexes the region!"
twrburyatia.10.c:0 "Pack up boys, we're going home!"
twrburyatia.11.t:0 "The Future of Buryatia"
twrburyatia.11.d:0 "In the land of forests and snow, of endless tundra and vigorous people, Buryatia stands strong. We have finally crushed our last big obstacle in the region- This being the nation of Norilsk. The Marines have finally completed their goal of bringing law and order back to a part of Siberia, subjugating the Norilsk warlord and bringing him to their will, achieving to bring some sense to stability to Siberia. \n\nBut as the soldiers cheer and the high command celebrates, the situation is somber. The people are not happy, they look with indifference, in tirenese...and we begin to realise, that we have overstayed our visit. Buryatia wants freedom. And so, Buryatia shall get it! We, however, have only one problem left to resolve. \n\nWho is to control these lands? \n\nOne option is to get in contact with the Russian Republic in Vladivostok and negotiate the unification between it and Buryatia, which will surely strengthen the Rus and give them a good fighting chance against the Bolsheviks. \n\nOr, on the other hand, we can begin the preparations for a Buryatian Social Democratic Republic, overseeing the peaceful transition and then leave this beautiful land to its own devices, happy at last."
twrburyatia.11.a:0 "Contact the Russian President, we will not keep the russian people disunited."
twrburyatia.11.b:0 "Long live the Buryatian Republic!"
