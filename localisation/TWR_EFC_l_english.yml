twrefcnews.1.d:0 "The Italian National Team, the Nazionale di Calcio dell'Italia, has won the 1952 European Football Cup in a surprising, but not unexpected, twist of events.\n\nTheir final match against the German team was one of the most tense matches yet during the tournament, as supporters from both teams watched in awe of the magnificent sportsmanship displayed. Eventually, through sheer willpower and determination, the Italians were able to score against keeper Fritz Herkenrath, landing the first and only goal of the match. The stadium echoed the thunderous roar of the Italian supporters that watched. The sky of Germania was filled with waving flags of the Italian Empire, as the team shook hands with von Ribbentrop. Hitler himself did not meet with the players, as he reportedly began to erupt in anger afterwards."
twrefcnews.1.a:0 "A satisfying conclusion."
twrefcnews.1.b:0 "A grand display of fascist ambition!"
twrefcnews.1.c:0 "The Italians are only good for football."

twrefcnews.2.t:0 "Spain Wins the EFC"
twrefcnews.2.d:0 "The Spanish National Team, the Selección Española de Fútbol, has won the 1952 European Football Cup after a long match against the Germans.\n\nTheir attendance was seen by many as a sign of Spain's long reconstruction coming to an end, as the nation had continued to suffer the consequences of the 1936 conflict that kept it from playing in the 1938 World Cup. After several minutes of defensive play on Germany's part, Telmo Zarra was able to steal the ball from former Swiss player René Bader and, with support from Silvestre Igoa, Spain scored their first goal. The second goal would follow 20 minutes later, as Estanislau Basora would break through the German lines and score a goal against keeper Fritz Herkenrath. The Spanish team was greeted by von Ribbentrop, but Hitler had left the stadium."
twrefcnews.2.a:0 "A satisfying conclusion."
twrefcnews.2.b:0 "Spain shows its relevance once more!"
twrefcnews.2.c:0 "Such a disappointment!"

twrefcnews.3.t:0 "Germany Wins the EFC"
twrefcnews.3.d:0 "The German National Team, Die Deutsche Fussballnationalmanschaft, has won the 1952 European Football Cup, winning against the Italians after a very tense match.\n\nThe German team, under the leadership of Sepp Herberger, former coach of the famous Breslau Eleven, had been a fan favourite in most of Europe since the beginning of the match. However, the team had quickly come under fire after accusations of using achievement enhancing drugs during the Hungary-Germany semi final and rumours of German bias. The final match, however, had been untainted by rumours or accusations. The German team, winning with 1-0 against Italy, scored the only goal of the match afer Robert Bernard stole it from Armedeo Amadei. Both Adolf Hitler and Joachim von Ribbentrop came to congratulate the players."
twrefcnews.3.a:0 "Welp, disappointing."
twrefcnews.3.b:0 "Such a boring match... I almost slept through it!"
twrefcnews.3.c:0 "We deserve our victory!"

twrefcnews.4.t:0 "France wins the EFC"
twrefcnews.4.d:0 "The French National Team, the Équipe de France de Football, has won the 1952 European Football Cup against Germany after an intense match.\n\nThe French Team was seen by many as a potentially dangerous variable in the tournament, with many claiming that the EFF was in the middle of experiencing a new Golden Generation of Footballers, with such stars as Just Fontaine and Robert Jonquet rising through the ranks of French football. The final match against the German national team clearly proved this "Golden Generation" theory, as the French team obliterated Germany with a 3-0 victory. This shock touched the German supporters, as their side remained awfully quiet after the second goal. While von Ribbentrop did greet the players, tension followed him as Hitler was missing."
twrefcnews.4.a:0 "A satisfying conclusion."
twrefcnews.4.b:0 "France may have lost the war, but we won!"
twrefcnews.4.c:0 "The nerve of the French!"

twrefcnews.5.t:0 "Hungary wins the EFC"
twrefcnews.5.d:0 "The Hungarian National Team, the Magyar Labdarúgó-Válogatott, has won the 1952 European Football Cup after one of the most surprising matches of the Cup.\n\nHungary and Austria have been seen by many as the place of birth of the Danube style of playing football, the same form of football that almost won against the Italians in the 1938 WC. Hungary has thus been a wildcard for most football fans. Having won against Greece, Ireland and Italy, Hungary quickly became a fan favourite in the finals. Ferenc Puskás quickly scored a goal in the first 10 minutes and would later score another goal, winning the match with 2-1. The victory was celebrated by all Hungarian supporters in the stadium, as von Ribbentrop greeted the Hungarians, Hitler quietly watched with von Ribbentrop on his side."
twrefcnews.5.a:0 "A satisfying conclusion to the EFC"
twrefcnews.5.b:0 "Hungarian football remains relevant!"
twrefcnews.5.c:0 "Could have been worse, I guess..."

twrsport.1.t:0 "The 1952 EFC"
twrsport.1.d:0 "After months of preparations and careful planning, the European Football Cup of 1952 has started.\n\nThe EFC was a plan proposed in 1950 by Joachim von Ribbentrop and Reichssportführer Karl Ritter von Halt as means to unite the continent. Sports, particularly football, have always been a great political and nationalist tool for politicians and others, as they perpetuate and celebrate the old "we-against-them" mentality and highlights the athletic superiourity of our race. These arguments helped von Ribbentrop in securing an annual fund from the government and its dependencies meant to organize one of the largest football cups of the European continent since the 1920s. \n\nThis year's EFC will be the first edition, thus exciting many. While taks of corruption have spread across the NSLEPE (National Socialist League of Europe for Physical Exercise) itself, the positive energy radiating from the event is enough to silence these rumours."
