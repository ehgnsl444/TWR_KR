 FFR_french_limbo_desc:0 "Since the surrender of the French Government in France, the French exiles have been stuck in a state of limbo. While most countries have officially recognised the German-backed French State as the sole legitimate government of France, 'Free France' based in French Africa, now the French Authority in Africa under British auspices, has refused to join or acknowledge the French State as a legitimate nation. With such a vague status, the question of the exiles remains an unanswered question."

 twrffr.0.t:0 "The French Authority"
 twrffr.0.d:0 "The 'French Authority' in former French West Africa is an odd government. With the fall of France to Nazi Germany in 1940 and the creation of a puppet government in Vichy, Charles de Gaulle, who had escaped to Britain, called for continued resistance across France and its colonies against the new government and its German overlords. However, the exit of Britain from the war following the Anglo-German armistice seemed to end any hopes of a 'Free' French government, as even the most hardline of the Free French saw their position as virtually hopeless.\n\nTo forestall the threat an independent Free France posed to its African holdings, Britain stepped in despite the armistice. As Germany issued powerless condemnations, British forces in Africa moved in to secure much of formerly French West Africa south of the Sahara, denying Petain's government control of these regions. From these holdings the French Authority arose: a semi-independent government led by former French colonial leaders, but under a high degree of British control. British troops patrol the streets, and the Union Jack flies alongside the French Tricolour in Dakar and Abudjan.\n\nThis arrangement was never meant to be lasting - it lies halfway between French colonial rule and British occupation, while African leaders increasingly call for greater autonomy, majority rule and even independence. One thing is certain. The fate of French Africa must involve radical change or certain collapse."
 twrffr.0.a:0 "Times are changing!"
 twrffr.1.t:0 "Protests in Dakar"
 twrffr.1.d:0 "The British rule in West Africa is being questioned by the locals and French exiles. Dakar erupted into popular unrest when both Whites and Blacks demanded self-rule and freedom from colonial oppression, on par with the dominions of Canada and Australia. The local garrison, in a moment of panic, opened fire on the protestors, killing 16 citizens.\n\nThe local elites are outraged, and they declare that they will be issuing a statement directed to the crown in the upcoming days."
 twrffr.1.a:0 "Damn..."
 twrffr.2.t:0 "The Modest Demands"
 twrffr.2.d:0 "Elites from both the Free France movement and local population have drafted a letter, issued to the Colonial Government. This letter detailed West Africa's desire to become self-ruling, stating five points which the British must do in order to have the hearts and minds of West Africa. They demand democracy and greater autonomy, rights to vote for their own Prime Minister instead of a Westminster appointed Governor. \n\nThe Colonial Government has yet to comment on how to handle this rising tide of public pressure."
 twrffr.2.a:0 "Hmm..."
 twrffr.3.t:0 "Statements to Westminster"
 twrffr.3.d:0 "Under unrelenting pressure from the local population, the French Authority has caved in to the demands of the masses. The Dakar Government has issued a forma letter to the Central Government, asking the British to consider this proposal throughly as a gesture to calm the rising unrest within West Africa. The French Authority, alongside their people, are calling for reforms within French Africa, and they must convince the British to stand by their side."
 twrffr.3.a:0 "Now, we wait."
 twrffr.31.t:0 "The Authority Demands Self-Rule"
 twrffr.31.d:0 "It appears that the arrangements we have made with Dakar are beginning to erode: the exiles and natives of the French Authority, our informal puppet-government in West Africa, are demanding a greater measure of self-rule. They call for free elections within the Authority, to allow democratic governments to be formed rather in the place of an increasingly brutal and unstable colonial regime. They argue that decolonization is inevitable, and the British should do the noble act of allowing French Africa to decide its own future for its own people."
 twrffr.31.a:0 "Grant them democracy."
 twrffr.31.b:0 "Pretend that we support them!"
 twrffr.4.t:0 "Britain Supports Reforms"
 twrffr.4.d:0 "Britain has responded by agreeing to the list of demands. They have promised the introduction of democracy within French Africa, allowing the locals to decide their own future within the British-protected area. Political movements have organised themselves into coherent parties, and they are now ready to run for history's first West African election."
 twrffr.4.a:0 "Hurrah for democracy!"
 twrffr.5.t:0 "Introducing Democracy"
 twrffr.5.d:0 "The West African Government and various political parties are now spreading the word across the region on their interpretation of the concept of democracy, with each party forwarding its own agenda across the many different populations. While many of these parties have been accused of spreading propaganda and fearmongering in their efforts to further the democratic process, these efforts are providing much needed basic political education to the rural population. At least, that is what we must tell ourselves..."
 twrffr.5.a:0 "Democracy for everyone!"
 twrffr.51.t:0 "The First Election Prepared"
 twrffr.51.d:0 "With the political campaigns and electioneering spreading rapidly within West Africa, the Government has prepared an election for the upcoming days. Politicians are now in the final phase of the race to become the first newly elected Prime Minister of West Africa. There have emerged three distinct parties behind these politicians: the Free French expatriates who represent the bourgeouis colonials and civil service in the cities, the Liberals who espouse egalitarianism for all, and the Federalists, who seek to transform the Authority into a true federation of equals."
 twrffr.51.a:0 "The election is here!"
 twrffr.52.t:0 "Election Results"
 twrffr.52.d:0 "After a tumultous Election Day, the ballot boxes are being emptied and their contents counted in West Africa's first democratic exercise in history. The political parties have succeeded in getting the local population to vote, with an impressive 54% turnout rate for the election. Free France is expected to strike an overwhelming victory, but the Liberals and Social Democrats are considered potential dark-horses with their Pro-African views."
 twrffr.52.a:0 "Free France!"
 twrffr.52.b:0 "The Liberals!"
 twrffr.52.c:0 "Federalists!"
 twrffr.52.e:0 "What? The Third Force!?"
 twrffr.6.t:0 "West African Unrest"
 twrffr.6.d:0 "As efforts to introduce democracy into West Africa continue to stagnate, locals have abandoned trust in the British; they are calling for aggressive resistance to what they view as unlawful occupation. Claiming the British have lied to them, they have organised massive demonstrations in urban areas; the violent British response of disbanding illegal assemblies by force and arresting protestors en masse has not helped at all. Dakar watches helplessly as its authority crumbles, and it is increasingly clear that the future of the Authority will be mired in blood."
 twrffr.6.a:0 "Oh no..."
 twrffr.61.t:0 "Authority Calls for British Intervention"
 twrffr.61.d:0 "The French Authority, noticing that the unrest is getting out of hand, has requested the British Government to step in. Local garrisons have been ordered to perform a wide range of repressive measures, including unlimited arrest warrants and the destruction of property belonging to the rebellious, and a state of martial law has been declared throughout West Africa."
 twrffr.61.a:0 "This is a mess..."
 twrffr.62.t:0 "Elections Cancelled"
 twrffr.62.d:0 "With violence threatening to overwhelm their grip over West Africa, the French Authority has declared that the planned elections have been cancelled due to safety concerns. In their official statement, they claim that the recent protests demonstrate the Authority's "manifest unreadiness" for changes in democracy, and that the status quo must be kept at all cost."
 twrffr.62.a:0 "Maybe we aren't ready for democracy..."
 twrffr.63.t:0 "French Authority Secured"
 twrffr.63.d:0 "We have successfully postponed democracy within French Africa; despite native disgust and international displeasure, the protests are dying down and the colonial experiment appears stable. For now, we aim to continue the current British-sponsored regime in West Africa, and eventually decolonize West Africa in the ideal, British image, other than the French idea of decolonization."
 twrffr.63.a:0 "We had to do this."
 twrffr.7.t:0 "Securing Our Independence"
 twrffr.7.d:0 "After Charles de Gaulle's victory in the elections, the process of securing French independence is underway. De Gaulle is now on his way to London to negotiate for West African France's absolute freedom, with the aim of securing recognition of De Gaulle's administration as the rightful French nation."
 twrffr.7.a:0 "Have a safe trip!"
 twrffr.71.t:0 "Position of the French Authority"
 twrffr.71.d:0 "With the newly elected administration of French Authority claiming to be under the banner of Free France, its leader, Charles de Gaulle, has arrived in London to discuss terms of allowing the French Authority independence from British rule. He demanded that French Africa should be removed from the list of British subjects, and be treated as a sovereign nation."
 twrffr.71.a:0 "Just let them go, it eases our finances."
 twrffr.71.b:0 "How about...no."
 twrffr.72.t:0 "Freedom Achieved"
 twrffr.72.d:0 "Charles de Gaulle's efforts to achieve total independence from Britain have ended successfully. The French Authority's appointed governor and colonial administration have been recalled and replaced by the local civil administration led by the Free French Government."
 twrffr.72.a:0 "Cheers!"
 twrffr.73.t:0 "The Great Betrayal"
 twrffr.73.d:0 "The British Government has denied de Gaulle's request for independence. The elected government is now suspended, with British forces stationed in major cities throughout French Africa. Resistance increases towards the new British policies."
 twrffr.991.t:0 "Free French Victory"
 twrffr.991.d:0 "After several battles on the African Border, the Mainland French Forces have evacuated West Africa, leaving the control of these colonies in the hands of Free France. With these colonies liberated, a pathway from Free France to Algeria has been opened, and preparation for the Reconquest might now begin."
 twrffr.991.a:0 "Vive la France!"
 twrffr.991.b:0 "Shame!"
 twrffr.992.t:0 "Stalemate on the Border"
 twrffr.992.d:0 "After battles on the African Border, Free French forces' attacks into West Africa have ended in failure. The local authority has managed to stop Free French attacks, but were unable to launch a counter-attack into Dakar, as the battle led to a stalemate.\n\nThis is no doubt a major setback for Free France's dream of reconquering Mainland France, and De Gaulle reportedly flew into a rage at the news; Dakar has declined official comments as of this time."
 twrffr.992.a:0 "Damnation!"
 twrffr.992.b:0 "Good!"
 twrffr.971.t:0 "The French Question"
 twrffr.971.d:0 "The Free French Government has requested Britain to transfer the occupied French territories back under Free French control. In an official communique, the Dakar regime has stated that the French Government appreciates the United Kingdom's efforts in temporarily holding onto these lands, and they think that now is the perfect time for the British to hand them back to its rightful owner."
 twrffr.971.a:0 "Sure."
 twrffr.971.b:0 "No."
 twrffr.9711.t:0 "Transfer Rejected"
 twrffr.9711.d:0 "The British government has refused to transfer their occupied french lands back to our control."
 twrffr.9711.a:0 "What a shame."
 twrffr.972.t:0 "The Colonial Transfer"
 twrffr.972.d:0 "Agreeing to hand back those territories, the British Government will be the one who decides just how much it is willing to give up for the Authority. After a brief secret cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister has finally decided to..."
 twrffr.972.a:0 "Hand them all back to the French."
 twrffr.972.b:0 "Keep the important ones."
 twrffr.972.c:0 "Just give them a token amount."
 twrffr.973.t:0 "Free French Demands"
 twrffr.973.d:0 "Our powerful neighours down South have requested our immediate submission; they have promised to allow us a great amount of autonomy but also stated that refusing this favourable deal would mean total destruction of the Saharan Council."
 twrffr.973.b:0 "We have no choice."
 twrffr.973.a:0 "Never!"
 twrffr.8.t:0 "Déclaration Unilatérale d'Indépendance"
 twrffr.8.d:0 "After months of preparation, the government of French West Africa has assembled in Dakar, signing the Déclaration Unilatérale d'Indépendance and announced the establishment of the Republic of Lazarie.\n\nTo consolidate French control, the French Authority has been disbanded, and Lazarie's immediate claims of sovereignty to the region have been shrunk to the Dakar area. Lazarie is not a recognised entity, multiple TA governments have informally demanded sanctions with Dakar for this unlawful action, and multiple African leaders have issued joint condemnations of what they see as a neo-colonial regime. For now, it appears, the birth of this so-called Republic will be shrouded in pariahhood..."
 twrffr.8.a:0 "Arise! For Lazarie!"
 twrffr.880.t:0 "Formation of Lazarie"
 twrffr.880.d:0 "In a matter of hours, parts of the French Authority government have cut all ties with Britain and disbanded French West Africa entirely, proclaiming their new 'Republic of Lazarie' a refuge for European French in Dakar. This sudden move has caused a massive power vacuum within West Africa, as African nations scramble to secure boundaries and military security. While Lazarie has renounced all claims on its former colonial holdings, their conflict of interest with the newly independent nation of Senegal will almost certainly trigger military action in the near future. \n\nNobody expects Lazarie to last, since its White population is tiny compared to the natives - it has close to no international support, and the TA has already threatened extraordinary sanctions. Only time will tell if this neo-colonial experiment will shine bright or gutter out."
 twrffr.880.a:0 "Another failed state."
 twrffr.880.b:0 "Lazarians Never Die!"
 twrffr.881.t:0 "The West African Embargo"
 twrffr.881.d:0 "The illegal government of 'Lazarie' has declared their independence from the British occupation authorities, effectively destroying the last pretences of unity within the West African region. As a member of the Accord, we must issue an embargo on this illegitimate state to ensure their failure. Surely this neocolonial experiment will soon rip itself apart; all we can do is help it on its merry way."
 twrffr.881.a:0 "They won't last."
 twrffr.9.t:0 "Lazarian-Senegalese War"
 twrffr.9.d:0 "The Republic of Lazarie's overlapping claims with Senegal have finally caused the inevitable: Prime Minister Raoul Salan has declared a state of "National Emergency", urging all able-bodied citizens to take up arms against the Senegali menace. The Senegalese Forces are overwhelming in numbers, but our elite Lazarian Light Infantry have trained for this contingency since the Authority's formation. \n\nThe first air attacks on Senegalese positions have already been made, and as the bombs drop the final stand to secure our new Republic begins. We will win a home here, or we must perish - no other option is left."
 twrffr.9.a:0 "Defend our Fatherland!"
 twrffr.882.t:0 "Lazarian-Senegalese War"
 twrffr.882.d:0 "It appears the newly formed nations of Senegal and Lazarie have abandoned peace. The unrecognized Republic of Lazarie declared talks with the Senegalese Republic futile in a unilateral statement today. President Léopold Sédar Senghor has declared Lazarie as "breakaway terrorists" in their illegal occupation" of North Senegal, and called the nation to arms with the aim of "expelling the French colonials".\n\nDe facto sanctions imposed by the Toronto Accord onto Lazarie will surely be a great advantage for the Senegalese Forces. The Lazarian Army, however, is well trained and experienced in comparison to their African counterparts, and they hold the slight advantage for having the only experienced air force within the entire West African Region."
 twrffr.882.a:0 "To war! Crush the imperialists!"
 twrffr.882.b:0 "For the Fatherland! For Lazarie!"
 twrffr.882.c:0 "Symptoms of a failed state."
 twrffr.10.t:0 "Azawad War"
 twrffr.10.d:0 "In the North, a group of nomads has occupied our rightful land under the banner of Azawad. To unify the Mali nation, Azawad must be pacified and our military must defeat these roaming nomads quickly, for our spies tell us that nationalist sentiment has spread like a cancer - if we do not act soon, separatism is inevitable. \n\nOur first scouting groups have arrived on the Azawad border, and faced the Azawadi's devastating 'Hit and Run' tactics. The remainder of the Malian Armed Forces are mobilizing, and Malian generals expect our forces to destroy these rebel nomads within weeks."
 twrffr.10.a:0 "Mali must be united!"
 twrffr.883.t:0 "Azawad War"
 twrffr.883.d:0 "On the plains of Northern Mali, group of Tuareg fighters calling themselves "Azawadis" are now engaging in guerrilla warfare against the Malian Forces. Both factions in this fight have relatively poor equipment due to the sudden collapse of French West Africa, but with the Federal Republic of Mali having the advantage of much greater numbers. President Modibo Keita has promised to crush the "False rebels of Azawad", and declared that his regime's goal is the building of a strong and unified Mali nation.\n\nThe reliance on poorly trained and undisciplined militia in this war amplifies the suffering caused by the conflict, with all of the Azawadi forces being a purely militia army without any semblance of central command. No matter who wins, it is clear that the ultimate loser of this war will be the already-suffering West African people."
 twrffr.883.a:0 "Victory or death!"
 twrffr.883.b:0 "Mali must be united!"
 twrffr.883.c:0 "Ok."
 twrffr.1111.t:0 "Free France in the Accord?"
 twrffr.1111.d:0 "Under Charles De Gaulle, the pretender government in French West Africa has declared their intentions to retake their lost homeland. To accomplish this, De Gaulle is seeking allies, trying to secure official partnership with the Toronto Accord by applying to become a member of the Accord. How should we respond to them?"
 twrffr.1111.a:0 "Welcome!"
 twrffr.1111.b:0 "Deny their application."
 twrffr.11110.t:0 "American Rejected our Application"
 twrffr.11110.d:0 "The Americans have denied our application to join as a member state of the Toronto Accord. In an internationally publicised statement, [USA.GetLeader]'s administration has confirmed that Free France is not a legitimate nation, and is therefore not qualified to become a partner."
 twrffr.11110.a:0 "Bastards!"
 twrffr.11111.t:0 "Free France Joins the Accord"
 twrffr.11111.d:0 "Under De Gaulle, the Free French Government has successfully joined the Toronto Accord as a member state. While Free France is considered an illegitimate nation by most countries which recognise the Paris government of the French State, the Toronto Accord have ignored conventional diplomatic norms and allowed Free France to enter as a member. This has naturally angered many French politicians within the French State, with political parties in Paris issuing an astonishing communique declaring the entire Free French movement "the last gasp of starveling brutes".\n\nThis action shows the commitment of the Accord to fight fascism and a diplomatic coup-de-grace for De Gaulle's Free France, as a major step towards becoming the legitimate government of France."
 twrffr.11111.a:0 "Together, against fascism!"
 twrffr.11111.b:0 "As expected!"

 twrffr.11.t:0 "French-African Confederation"
 twrffr.11.d:0 "After the surrender of France to the German brutes, French West Africa was usurped by the British Government. These new colonizers allowed the former French administrators and elites to rule as proxies for their benefit, oppressing the majority while creating unneeded racial tension between the natives and the French exiles.\n\nTo end this tension, the new regime has crafted a drastic plan to establish a French-African Confederation where ethnic minorities will receive equal rights of representation with the French expatriates. The traditional role of oppressors and the oppressed, and the brutal horrors of the past, shall be washed away with the creation of a new, harmonious land for the people of West Africa."
 twrffr.11.a:0 "Arise, a new nation!"

 twrffr.11001.t:0 "French Authority Succeeds"
 twrffr.11001.d:0 "The recently elected West African regime has chosen to break its ties with the British government, proclaiming itself a fully independent nation. Formal notices of expulsion have also reached our units garrisoned in the region, many of which have been only too happy to leave what they consider a hellhole.\n\nWe have expected this action since the day we allowed their election to go ahead, and there is nothing we can do to retain this giant former colony. May their independence bring the region peace, and our empire normalcy."
 twrffr.11001.a:0 "Oh well."

 twrffr.12.t:0 "Lifting of the Political Ban"
 twrffr.12.d:0 "It appears that the recent election has spooked London; the new collaborator-regime has issued a ban on all homegrown African political groups. Only prominent French exile parties were allowed a voice within the parliament, but our new liberal agenda calls for a lift of this ban and the immediate crafting of legislation allowing natives of West Africa to form their own political organizations. We must fight tooth adn nail to make this country better - and the British ignore this struggle at their peril."
 twrffr.12.a:0 "Everyone deserves a voice!"

 twrffr.81.t:0 "French-African Confederation"
 twrffr.81.d:0 "As the mandate of the recently elected regime of French West Africa, the attempts at mending relationship between the French and the natives have evolved to a formation of an entirely new nation, proclaiming the formation of the French-African Confederation.\n\nHowever, the newly formed Confederation is already facing a number of problems, with widespread discrimination a constant problem between French and African groups. French communities are reportedly frightened by the idea of legislative action from the natives, and multiple native groups are now planning their separation with their newfound freedom. Time will tell if the ideals of the Confederation will survive, or if their naivete will destroy them."
 twrffr.81.a:0 "Interesting."

 twrffr.13.t:0 "The Nationalist Union of West Africa"
 twrffr.13.d:0 "With the freedom granted by our regime, groups of prominent African nationalists have gathered and formed the Nationalist Union of West Africa, drafting a mutual pact for the goal of national independence for all African nations of West Africa.\n\nWhile the legality of the group is justified by our recent lift on political gatherings and activity, we have no appetite to watch our hard-won sovereignty collapse. By branding this group as a terrorist cell, we might be able to shut them down before any major harm is done to the unity of the Confederation."
 twrffr.13.a:0 "Crackdown on these terrorists!"
 twrffr.13.b:0 "Allow this group to operate!"

 twrffr.15.t:0 "The First West African Congress"
 twrffr.15.d:0 "Attempting to appease the locals, the French-African Confederation has summoned the First West African Congress, a legislative body formed by representatives across French West Africa, designed to pass laws with the best interest of both French and Africans in mind. However, due to population differences, the French representatives are greatly outnumbered by their local counterparts. Despite protests by some French interest groups, this issue was deemed to be insignificant - representatives were made to swear allegiance to the Confederation above and beyond ethnicity before taking up position within the congress."
 twrffr.15.a:0 "Democracy in action!"

 twrffr.16.t:0 "Congress Elects the African League"
 twrffr.16.d:0 "Mere hours after the congress was called, the first act of the representatives was to oust the current government with a congress elected one, bypassing all legislations laid before the democratic arrangements with Britain. A majority of the representatives in congress are members of the African League, a 'Pan-African Socialist' coalition of moderate revolutionaries willing to participate in governmental affairs. Some members of this party have ties with the African Nationalists, and their sheer number has nullified any opposition from the French representatives and moderates of congress. A young, rising star of the African League - Gérard Kango Ouédraogo - has now ascended to the position of Prime Minister of the French-African Confederation, and as African Socialists celebrate across the Confederation any opposition is drowned out in the cheer."
 twrffr.16.a:0 "This is fine, majority rule!"

 twrffr.17.t:0 "The Redemption and Acquisition Act"
 twrffr.17.d:0 "Not long after the African League was elected with overwhelming numbers in the congress, African legislators have drafted a policy proposal, presenting to the congress as a plan named the 'African Act'.\n\nOn the surface, this act if enacted will ensure the redistribution of wealth for poor, discriminated Africans of West Africa, ensuring equal opportunity for Africans after generations of discrimination. However, the means through which this measure will be funded are far more controversial; European-descent and French citizens will have their properties seized, and outright 80% of their wealth will be confiscated for the 'greater good of West Africa'.\n\nWithout a doubt, this draft was aimed towards the French of this so-called 'French-African Confederation', but any voices of reason were drowned out by the chants of African League, with the French representatives forcefully removed from the chamber before a landslide victory for the African Act, renamed to the more appropriate "Redemption and Acquisition Act". It was followed by an Executive Order removing all citizens of French heritage from their positions in government, commerce, land-owndership and political involvement in West Africa."
 twrffr.17.a:0 "Break the chains!"

 twrffr.17021.t:0 "The West African Transition"
 twrffr.17021.d:0 "After the enactment of the 'Redemption and Acquisition Act' in the newly formed French-African Confederation, the African majority party known as the African League has turned on their French partners. As foreign-affiliated businesses are seized, whole districts and towns burn to the ground as the French are violently expelled from their former refuge.\n\nHundreds of French families have fled the country in fear, with all French officials removed from public office and several facing public execution. It is unclear on rather the hate would continue, but this major event has prolonged the instability in West Africa."
 twrffr.17021.a:0 "In the name of freedom!"
 twrffr.17021.b:0 "Concerning."

 twrffr.18.t:0 "End of the First West African Congress"
 twrffr.18.d:0 "With its own dramatic upsets and development, the First West African Congress has ended with a fresh new leadership and government, bringing a new chapter for the 'French-African Confederation'. The African League is actively drafting a plan to unite West Africa under one name and one banner, to accomplish their goal of Pan-African Socialism."
 twrffr.18.a:0 "What a major success!"

 twrffr.19.t:0 "Nationalist Demands"
 twrffr.19.d:0 "Localists and members of the Nationalist Union have once again surfaced, calling for a general election to determine the fate of West Africa. These groups claim that, with the 'White Devils' out of the picture, West Africans should be able to determine their own fate, and it is the job of the League to provide everyone with a referendum on whether West Africa should stay united or be abolished into its own respective nations."
 twrffr.19.a:0 "We will offer no quarter to terrorism!"
