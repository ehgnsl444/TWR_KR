### BORMANN'S GERMANY ###
# do i really need to this from scratch? aw dang #

BGR_Bormanns_Here:0 "Bormann Is Here!"
BGR_Bormanns_Here_desc:0 "The death of Hitler has brought chaos and misery to the German nation. The only way forward to a brighter future is through the guidance of our new Fuhrer, Martin Bormann! We must invest all our faith in him, for he has risen from the ashes of the civil war and will bring Germany with him! Hitler may be gone, but Bormann is here!"
BGR_After_Bormann:0 "Gone with Bormann"
BGR_After_Bormann_desc:0 "We've done it! Martin Bormann, together with his incompetence and blatant corruption has been deposed by a coalition of like minded gentlemen determined to save the Reich.... Wait!? Who's in charge now!?"
BGR_Corruption_Finest:0 "Corruption's the Finest"
BGR_Corruption_Finest_desc:0 "Under Hitler's leadership, many large businesses became essentially part of the state. Under Bormann, the state is starting to become a business, and politics has become very lucrative these days. Some call it corruption, but we could certainly use these funds generated to help reform our economy, and it's certainly not corruption if we use it to benefit the nation right? These days, money makes the Reich go round."
BGR_Return_of_The_RKs:0 "Return of the Reichkommissariats"
BGR_Return_of_The_RKs_desc:0 "With Germania at last secure, we must once again focus eastward. Our Reichkommissariats must realize that Germany is back, and that they rightfully belong to us and us alone! It is imperative to ensure their return to the Reich in order to integrate them in the future. Otherwise, the Fuhrer's ambitions will have been desecrated, and the sacrifice of our troops in the East will have been in vain."
BGR_Secret_Bunker:0 "Secret Bunkers"
BGR_Secret_Bunker_desc:0 "In preparation for a nuclear attack against the Reich during its moment of weakness, Bormann has ordered the creation of numerous secret bunker complexes to secure the survival of Germany's best and brightest. These bunkers must be created as soon as possible, as we are vulnerable to an attack at any moment..."
BGR_Victory_Through_Acts:0 "Victory Through Actions"
BGR_Victory_Through_Acts_desc:0 "The only way to ensure the stability of the Reich and to achieve ultimate victory is through decisive action. We cannot afford to be conciliatory during these trying times, and trust is simply too difficult to retain. As we have seen, elements of the Reich seemingly loyal to the Fuhrer were willing to tear the country apart to achieve their own ends. Hitler must be avenged. Bormann stands alone."
BGR_Fuhrer_Was_Killed:0 "The Fuhrer Was Killed!"
BGR_Fuhrer_Was_Killed_desc:0 "Despite many people thinking our beloved Fuhrer had perished peacefully, it seems there may have been a much more sinister explanation. Overwhelming evidence suggests the Fuhrer was actually assassinated. As to who orchestrated it is uncertain, however, action must be taken at once. It may be best if the general population is unaware of this matter for the time being..."
BGR_Doubters_Are_Jews:0 "Doubters Are Jews!"
BGR_Doubters_Are_Jews_desc:0 "The German people are a very noble and principled people, possessing many virtues. Chief among these principles are faith and loyalty. However, as we all know, the Jewish people possess none of these virtues, and are the polar opposite of the Germanic Aryan peoples. Rather than being faithful and loyal, the Jews are nothing but skeptical, unloyal, and subversive. For these reasons, it is clear to any bright minded German that those who doubt the existence of this plot are none other than the Jews!"
BGR_Doubts_Are_Treasons:0 "Doubts Are Treason!"
BGR_Doubts_Are_Treasons_desc:0 "It seems there are also some among our ranks who have doubts of their own. Perhaps their lack of faith reflects their deeper treachery?  It is plain to see; those who are doubting this plot are one of two things: they are plotters themselves or do not care about the betrayal of our Fuhrer. Either way, these actions are clearly tantamount to treason!"
BGR_Silence_The_Party:0 "Silence The Party"
BGR_Silence_The_Party_desc:0 "Exposing this plot has proven to be a very delicate and serious task. As such, we must tread lightly. The party must not be at liberty to speak at all on this matter. We shall tightly regulate the flow of information surrounding the details of this plot, and prevent the party from bickering over the validity of the claims or attempting to spread lies to the German people."
BGR_The_53_Documents:0 "The 53' Documents"
BGR_The_53_Documents_desc:0 "The dossier has finally been compiled. Contained within these documents is the most crucial and compelling evidence of the successful assassination plot against Hitler. With this documented evidence at hand, we may now proceed with even more confidence in our mission to rid the Reich of her most treacherous scum."
BGR_Ultimatum_To_SS:0 "Ultimatum To The SS"
BGR_Ultimatum_To_SS_desc:0 "The SS began as Hitler's personal bodyguard service, before slowly evolving into the complex organization it is today. It is thus quite ironic to think that the SS could ever allow an attempt on Hitler's life to succeed. Yet, the dossier seems to suggest this was the case. We must issue an ultimatum, demanding the SS to hand over known traitors to the state immediately, and to comply with all further investigation and potential prosecutions."
BGR_Ultimatum_To_Old_Allies:0 "Ultimatum To Old Allies"
BGR_Ultimatum_To_Old_Allies_desc:0 "Hitler built for himself an entourage composed of some of the most bright and capable men in all of Europe. Yet, it seems some of these men were too egotistical for their own good, as they had betrayed their Fuhrer for their own advantages. They also harbor a deep resentment and disloyalty for our new Fuhrer, Martin Bormann. As hard as this may be for the Fuhrer to order, these men must accept our demands to stand down and resign, or face the wall."
BGR_Traitors_From_Within:0 "Traitors From Within"
BGR_Traitors_From_Within_desc:0 "Additionally, the dossier has uncovered many traitors from deep within the government and the party. These men, who are unloyal to the state (and definitely not Bormann personally) must be purged from our ranks."
BGR_Fake_Proof:0 "Fake The Proof"
BGR_Fake_Proof_desc:0 "Despite all the irrefutable evidence against Bormann's opponents, or traitors against the state rather, it is still not enough for some of the more harsh skeptics within Reich. Thus, it has become necessary for us to forge some of this evidence ourselves. There is nothing wrong with this however, as we know very well that Bormann is right and his opponents are truly guilty of their crimes."
BGR_Stellvertreter:0 "The Acting Representative"
BGR_Stellvertreter_desc:0 "With Bormann now in power, his position must be secured. He must not be seen as separate from the party, but rather as the very representative embodiment of the party, and therefore also of the German nation."
BGR_Eva_Braun_Arrested:0 "The Brotherly Arrest"
BGR_Eva_Braun_Arrested_desc:0 "The Fuhrer's brother, former SA Gruppenfuher Albert Bormann, has been recently outed as a known communist sympathizer. As much as it pains him, Fuhrer Bormann must take action and arrest Albert as soon as possible. It is an ugly stain on the Fuhrer's reputation, one which cannot be ignored."
BGR_Bormanns_Death_Squads:0 "Bormann's Death Squads"
BGR_Bormanns_Death_Squads_desc:0 "Fuhrer Bormann has been thrusted into a very precarious position. He faces intense levels of opposition from numerous popular figures within the Reich and is left not knowing who to trust. In order to silence this opposition Bormann has secretly created his own personal \"death squads.\" Whether or not these units shall succeed in their tasks while remaining undetected remains to be seen..."
BGR_Execute_The_Doctors:0 "Execute The Doctors"
BGR_Execute_The_Doctors_desc:0 "Recently it has been discovered that a formerly renowned doctor in Germania was of Jewish heritage. Since then, Bormann has come to believe that many doctors in Germania are secretly Jews, and that they are plotting to overthrow the government, in a conspiracy known as the \"Doktors Plot.\" These treacherous doctors must be fired and arrested immediately!"
BGR_Execute_All_Witnesses:0 "Execute All Witnesses"
BGR_Execute_All_Witnesses_desc:0 "Despite the justified arrests and executions carried out by Bormann's \"death squads,\" there is still a growing concern over the witnesses to these spontaneous attacks, especially some of the wives of suspects who were arrested, beaten, or were killed in their homes after resisting their arrest. Despite Bormann ordering these witnesses to sign agreements of nondisclosure and to vow to remain silent, sometimes loose ends just have to be dealt with. Permanently."
BGR_Burn_Evidences:0 "Burn The Evidences"
BGR_Burn_Evidences_desc:0 "Though Bormann has taken great deliberation in leaving little evidence behind of his \"secret operations,\" he has still generated quite a paper trail. These documents are potentially very dangerous if fallen into the wrong hands. As such, any documents related to \"Operation Uberfall\" must be promptly burned and destroyed."
BGR_Monthly_Purges:0 "Monthly Purges"
BGR_Monthly_Purges_desc:0 "With the success of Operation Uberfall, Bormann has decided to enact a policy of monthly purges in order to keep his subordinates on their toes and in order to ensure \"loyalty through terror.\" From now on, the existence of Bormmann's secret Death Squads will be known by all, yet never spoken of. You never know who's listening."
BGR_End_All_Oppositions:0 "The End of Opposition"
BGR_End_All_Oppositions_desc:0 "The first step toward securing Bormann's new position as Fuhrer is to put an end to all official and outright opposition toward him. His enemies may be numerous, and come from both within and without, but in due time they shall all be dealt with."
BGR_Masterful_Plotter:0 "Masterful Schemer"
BGR_Masterful_Plotter_desc:0 "Bormann has proven to be quite adept in his political scheming, hatching up clever strategies to deal with his opponents. These schemes may just be clever enough to work, and thus it would be wise to utilize them."
BGR_With_Cloak:0 "Cloak and Dagger"
BGR_With_Cloak_desc:0 "Lately there have been rumors uncovered of secret plots against Bormann, just as those which had existed during Adolf Hitler's tenure as Fuhrer. We must put these plots (and their plotters) to rest once and for all, through covert means and espionage efforts."
BGR_The_49_Documents:0 "The 49' Documents"
BGR_The_49_Documents_desc:0 "The treasonous opposition to Bormann's administration is without a doubt both dangerous and genuine. We must compile a compelling dossier containing evidence of plotting and treason within our ranks, in order to more publicly justify any further action we wish to take."
BGR_SnG_Backed_Coup:0 "Speer and Goebbels"
BGR_SnG_Backed_Coup_desc:0 "Albert Speer and Josef Goebbels are a troublesome pair. They are both outwardly opposed to us, and are also very popular figures in the Reich. It would be unwise to target them in the same manner in which we have targeted our less publicly-favored opposition, and, thus, it would better suit us to pacify them by bringing them under our influence."
BGR_Power_Is_What_Matters:0 "Ultimate Power"
BGR_Power_Is_What_Matters_desc:0 "With Bormann's political opposition promptly dealt with, it seems his position is at last secure. He is now left presently unchallenged in his position as Fuhrer, with the future of the nation seemingly at his disposal. Heil Bormann!"
BGR_Shaking_Hands:0 "Shaking Hands"
BGR_Shaking_Hands_desc:0 "Though our efforts in quelling dissidence has proven quite effective, it is not enough to simply silence our enemies and sow resentment within our ranks. We must, therefore, adopt a more conciliatory attitude going forward, and attempt to establish loyal friendships. It may be better to be feared than to be loved, but why not attempt to achieve both?"
BGR_Successful_Meeting:0 "Successful Meeting"
BGR_Successful_Meeting_desc:0 "Bormann's meeting between him and numerous important government figures (and potential rivals) has proven to be a success. Everyone has walked away from the meeting with a feeling of confidence in Bormann as their new leader, and everyone seems to agree that unity is the only way to achieve success and to maintain the stability of the Reich."
BGR_Caught_Red_Handed:0 "Caught Red Handed"
BGR_Caught_Red_Handed_desc:0 "After putting together an unsuccessful meeting between himself and his potential rivals, Bormann has landed himself into hot water. The silencing of his opposition, and the false dossier of evidence he compiled against them, have been brought to light, and now numerous important figures are calling for Bormann's resignation as Fuhrer. If he refuses, it is likely that these influential men within the Reich's government will order his arrest on the grounds of treason. Perhaps Bormann was the real traitor after all..."
BGR_Krebs_Other_Junta:0 "Krebs' Junta"
BGR_Krebs_Other_Junta_desc:0 "Hans Krebs and his military colleagues have swept aside the petty politicians who would see the Reich slip into chaos and inefficiency and established a ruling junta. The former military attache to the USSR has never been overly important... but now look who the biggest fish in the pond is!"
BGR_Power_Gun:0 "Power Comes from Guns"
BGR_Power_Gun_desc:0 "Oh look some students are complaining about how they want to unleash their decadent sexuel cravings onto our streets, send in a platoon with rifles that will shut them up! Oh what's that, some dirty bolshevik workers are striking due to unequal pay, set up some MG42's and they will zip their mouths up!"
BGR_Politics_Are_Simple:0 "Einfachepolitik"
BGR_Politics_Are_Simple_desc:0 "Why are politics so complicated? All that seems to come of politics are arguments, followed by some more arguments. And once that dust has settled, what's that around the corner? Oh yes, more arguments. Politics should be simplified, no need for debate. We just say we are going to do something, and everyone can just applaud our genius."
BGR_Having_Powers_Fine:0 "Power is Might"
BGR_Having_Powers_Fine_desc:0 "Power is power, there is no debate. He who has the most guns has control over any situation. Hans Krebs's authority over Germany is unquestionable! Anyone who questioned or criticised him has been shot."
BGR_Ley_Appointed:0 "Sauckel Appointed"
BGR_Ley_Appointed_desc:0 "Fritz Sauckel has ascended to the head of the German government. A Guelieter and General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment, he has always been a man in the shadows of greater personalities. But now Sauckel rules supreme, and his benefactors shall reap the rewards!"
BGR_Oligarchs_Share:0 "Oligarchs' Shares"
BGR_Oligarchs_Share_desc:0 "The masses do not possess the brain power, nore the loyalty to the Reich to control their own business and government. Sauckels own business allies are men who will do what's best for the economy... and their wallets."
BGR_Labour_Is_Purchaseable:0 "Labour is Purchaseable"
BGR_Labour_Is_Purchaseable_desc:0 "The Reich has slaves, and Sauckel likes slaves. The oligarchs have cash, and Sauckel likes cash. We have been missing a cash cow here! We shall offer these \"workers\" up for sale. It's a perfect means of fixing our economy and providing a workforce to our business backers."
BGR_Buy_Positions:0 "Sell Positions"
BGR_Buy_Positions_desc:0 "Wealth is a sign of success, and retaining wealth shows one is capable of managing it. There are men who seek political, military and localised positions of power but are unable to progress due to the silver tongues of slimy bootlickers. Sauckel can help these individuals out, for a price."
BGR_Wegner_Appointed:0 "Klopfer Appointed"
BGR_Wegner_Appointed_desc:0 "Gerhard Klopfer, assistant to Martin Bormann has successfully assumed the chancellorship. Klopfer's standing in the party increased tenfold following Bormann's rise to power. Klopfer has paid back his former superior by usurping his place. But many are left asking the same question... Who the hell is Gerhard Klopfer?"
BGR_Bormanns_Style:0 "Bormann Style"
BGR_Bormanns_Style_desc:0 "Klopfer is the model protege in every conceivable way, to the point that many have barely noticed any difference in the change of leadership. Some have even started up conspiracy theories, mostly around the belief Martin Bormann is still controlling the government behind the scenes... what nonsense..."
BGR_Enforce_Our_Status_Quo:0 "Enforcing Our Status Quo"
BGR_Enforce_Our_Status_Quo_desc:0 "There is nothing wrong in the Reich! Everything is perfect, all critiques are from traitors, jews and communists. Anyway the common people need not concern themselves with the issues of government. We are doing our best to keep the Reich alive... aren't we..."
BGR_Carry_On_Bormanns_Work:0 "Continue Bormann's Work"
BGR_Carry_On_Bormanns_Work_desc:0 "The good work continues, through our hard work shifting papers and covering up a few... issues here and there the Reich continues to function. Klopfer has ensured that all his former boss worked for is secured... Why did we depose Bormann again?"
BGR_Axman_Appointed:0 "Axmann Appointed"
BGR_Axman_Appointed_desc:0 "Reichsjugendführer Artur Axmann has secured his position as Chancellor of the German Reich. The head of the Hitler Youth is a skilled orator with a loyal basis of support... well a loyal support base from children and teenagers... but a base of support none the less!"
BGR_Youth_Guards:0 "Young Guards"
BGR_Youth_Guards_desc:0 "The Hitler Youth are the future of Germany and National Socialism. These youths should be entrusted with greater responsibilities, both regionally and nationally! They need to learn responsibility eventually after all..."
BGR_Lesser_Of_Useless:0 "Lesser of Useless"
BGR_Lesser_Of_Useless_desc:0 "Many called Bormann's deposition the doom of the Reich and the end of its development. Axmann shall prove that he and his new government, composed of new blood, is not useless!"
BGR_The_Actual_Politician:0 "The Actual Politician"
BGR_The_Actual_Politician_desc:0 "Axmann's skills as an orator were instrumental in promoting the \"ideology\" of Bormann and his wing of the party. Now that Bormann is gone, Axmann has naturally shifted his position drastically to accommodate his new role as head of the Reich."
BGR_Daluege_Coup:0 "Daluege's Coup"
BGR_Daluege_Coup_desc:0 "All of the conspirators against Bormann have been arrested in the course of a single night! Kurt Daluege has secured his power base, using his Order Police forces to conduct a well planned decapitation strike against his former allies. It seems brute force has won the day...again."
BGR_Order_Police_State:0 "Discounted Police State"
BGR_Order_Police_State_desc:0 "Daluege and his Orpo forces have obliterated the status quo, and in its place a new kind of terror state emerges. The powers of the Orpo have been expanded enormously and a mass recruitment drive enacted. Soon, every street will have a loyal Orpo man watching over it. None will dare oppose us!"
BGR_End_The_Gestapo_Fear:0 "End the Gestapo's Rule"
BGR_End_The_Gestapo_Fear_desc:0 "The Gestapo have held a monopoly over security in the Reich for years, their power growing to gargantuan size. Daluege has had enough of their messing in his business, time to take them down a notch."
BGR_My_Terror:0 "My Rule"
BGR_My_Terror_desc:0 "Order is the name of the day! The order of Kurt Daleuge, and Kurt Daleuge alone. They called him a brute and a bully. Heydrich called him \"the idiot\" and \"Dummi-Dummi\". Well look who's laughing now! "
BGR_Incompetent_But_Secured:0 "Successful Incompetence"
BGR_Incompetent_But_Secured_desc:0 "We've done it! The Reich is still alive, and without Bormann! We have proved ourselves capable of leadership on our own. Is every problem fixed... well no but... there will always be problems. To expect perfection is too much and unrealistic. Mediocre... we can settle for."
BGR_Funds_Equals_Power:0 "Funds Equal Power"
BGR_Funds_Equals_Power_desc:0 "As the coffers of the state fill, our power increases. Who knew, you don't have to rely solely on violence and intimidation to fulfil your goals? Sometimes, money actually works just as well! But let's not let this newfound power go to waste..."
BGR_Hands_Off:0 "Hands Off"
BGR_Hands_Off_desc:0 "Well, they say money doesn't buy you happiness. While that may be true, it can still buy you some time and space. As long as the nation continues on its course, there isn't much reason to get involved in its affairs. All that has to be done is to maintain the wealth (power) we possess."
BGR_Germania_Biased:0 "Germania First"
BGR_Germania_Biased_desc:0 "Though our nation is quite large and lacking in development in certain areas, we must still focus on taking care of Germania. After all, what were the Romans without Rome? The Reich is weak without a stronger Germania. Renovations and modernizations must be maintained to ensure our capital remains the greatest in the whole world!"
BGR_Concentrated_Power:0 "Concentrated Power"
BGR_Concentrated_Power_desc:0 "It has become quite inefficient and tiresome to maintain our incredibly complex bureaucracy. Thus, we must focus on centralization efforts, bringing more institutions under the jurisdiction and control of the NSDAP, especially within Germania. In doing so, we will strengthen our party and be rid of our inefficiencies."
BGR_Germania_Only:0 "For Germania Only"
BGR_Germania_Only_desc:0 "Despite the resentment this decision may cause, we must keep the vast majority of our wealth and capital within the confines of Germania. Hitler's dream city must become a vast utopia and an example for all other cities to follow!"
BGR_Work_In_Debt:0 "Working in Debt"
BGR_Work_In_Debt_desc:0 "Despite the state's increased accumulation of wealth we still find ourselves in a state of crippling debt. As a result, we must be pragmatic in our government spending in order to help balance the budget, perhaps even adopting drastic measures."
BGR_Ignorance_Is_Bliss:0 "Ignorance is Bliss"
BGR_Ignorance_Is_Bliss_desc:0 "The problems of our society are simply too complex for the vast majority of people to understand, which is why our government consists of a select elite who rule from Germania. The masses, however, would be better off without the troubling thoughts associated with our socioeconomic issues, and thus must be kept in the dark. We don't need more thinkers; we need loyal workers."
BGR_Political_Commanders:0 "Political Commanders"
BGR_Political_Commanders_desc:0 "With the weakening of our nation's armed forces following the civil war, we must adopt new strategies in order to maintain a capable and loyal fighting force. One such idea is the appointment of political commanders. These commanders would be able to raise local militias, capable of resisting against an enemy force in the case of an allied invasion. This seems too promising of a solution for us to ignore."
BGR_Fund_The_Military_Complex:0 "Fund The Military Complex"
BGR_Fund_The_Military_Complex_desc:0 "Due to a lack of state funds, it would be unwise to have the government foot the entire bill of military spending. Instead of this, we could simply fund and subsidize private manufacturers in order to incentivize the creation of new designs and to increase arms production."
BGR_Useless_Education:0 "Education is Useless"
BGR_Useless_Education_desc:0 "The way in which Speerist reformism infiltrated our academia has proven that we need to double down on controlling our nation's education system. Education, especially at a collegian level, has become far too important to the German people. We must teach them that education is inconsequential, compared to the challenges and issues the nation faces today."
BGR_Benefit_The_Powerful:0 "Benefit the Mighty"
BGR_Benefit_The_Powerful_desc:0 "Our new Germany, built through National Socialist doctrine, has always placed a great emphasis on strength. It is what is needed to break the cycle of history and to ensure the greatness of our nation. Consequently. we must ensure that our economic measures will benefit the strong, rather than the weak."
BGR_All_Connected:0 "All Connected"
BGR_All_Connected_desc:0 "Our government has been formed into an effective bureaucracy capable of managing and overseeing many aspects of our nation's economy. We must further centralize and connect key industries into the hands of the state, while continuing to cooperate with private businesses."
BGR_Cut_Government_Funds:0 "Cut Government Funds"
BGR_Cut_Government_Funds_desc:0 "With the increased centralization of our economy, we no longer see any value in funding or subsidizing private industry as much as we have in years past. We simply cannot afford to continue spending at this rate."
BGR_Meetings_With_The_Army:0 "Meetings With the Army"
BGR_Meetings_With_The_Army_desc:0 "As Germany has just undergone a state of great national upheaval, there are many questions which have to be answered about many aspects of our administration, and the army is no exception. We will sit down with the leaders of the German military in order to craft our plan moving forward."
BGR_Modest_Military:0 "Modest Military"
BGR_Modest_Military_desc:0 "Our predecessors were more interested in fantastical ideas like the Amerika bomber than practical military strategy, and that brought Germany into decline. We will build an effective, powerful, and above all, modest military force."
BGR_Contented_Military:0 "Contented Military"
BGR_Contented_Military_desc:0 "It is true when they that the military is the fourth branch of government, and we must keep that in mind if we seek to bring Germany forward into the future. The officers will get their concessions, and they will get their trinkets. All for Germany."
BGR_Keep_The_Old_Guards:0 "Keep the Old Guards"
BGR_Keep_The_Old_Guards_desc:0 "In times of national crisis, it is better to work with what you have than to try something completely new. We will maintain the old officer class, in order to better facilitate our transition."
BGR_Largest_Army:0 "Largest Army"
BGR_Largest_Army_desc:0 "In an age where the state with the most money to drop on its army is typically the one who wins in international disputes, we must focus on expanding the German military to its largest possible size. The Americans will fear the unstoppable titan which is the German Heer."
BGR_Bormanns_Guards:0 "Bormann Guards"
BGR_Bormanns_Guards_desc:0 "The officers are just as much to blame for Germany's decline as the contradictions within the party. We must institute a total transformation of the German officer class, and create one which is loyal to Bormann."
BGR_Loyal_To_The_Leader:0 "Loyal to the Leadership"
BGR_Loyal_To_The_Leader_desc:0 "An army is nothing if its soldiers do not believe in or follow what their officers command of them. In our reform of the German Heer, we must ensure the loyalty of the enlisted."
BGR_The_Test:0 "The Test"
BGR_The_Test_desc:0 "Although we are working hard to reform the German Heer, we must have a system in place to make sure that the most important and influential officers are following the new party line. No one is above suspicion, and all will be tested on their strength of loyalty, both towards the Fuhrer and towards national socialism."
BGR_Purge_The_Officers:0 "Purge the Officers"
BGR_Purge_The_Officers_desc:0 "We have found rot in the German officer corp once again! Several subservies and opportunists have found themselves in the highest positions of German military might, and we must remove them at once. For the protection of Germany and the Aryan race."
BGR_Limited_Conscription:0 "Limited Conscription"
BGR_Limited_Conscription_desc:0 "Now that we have tried and tested the loyalty of each part of the German Heer, we ought to be careful about who and how many people we're letting in now. It will make our military much smaller, but we will maintain the loyalty we have fought so hard to build. "

## Events ##
twrbormann.1.t:0 "The '53 Documents"
twrbormann.1.d:0 "\"Traitors! I stand in a hall filled to devious traitors!\"\n\nMartin Bormann's voice booms across an otherwise silent Reichstag. He stands at the central podium, presenting a series of documents which detail an inner-party conspiracy to kill former Führer Adolf Hitler. These documents has named several influential party members, multiple of them in high positions of power, and they are painted as central factors in the killing of Hitler.\n\nFew actually believe the document's allegations to be accurate, but even less are willing to step into Bormann's political warpath. He announces that a trial will be held in the Reichstag over the coming weeks. In it, the so-called evidence against the supposedly traitorous companies will be presented and evaluated. In that judgement, the future of Germany will be forged."
twrbormann.1.a:0 "Let us see how this goes."
twrbormann.2.t:0 "An Ultimatum to the SS"
twrbormann.2.d:0 "The SS always knew how to make a job far harder than it needed to be. Like a poor man's Praetorian Guard, you couldn't trust them with anything, lest they use it against you down the line to gain any power they can. Bormann was well aware of this fact, and he kept it well in mind as his jackboots' striking on the ground echoed down the halls of Wewelsburg Castle. Bormann rounded into the North Tower and entered the grand hall which was guarded by a small bodyguard detail. At the end of the hall looking out of a massive ornate window stood Heinrich Himmler, who turned immediately to greet him.\n\n\"Ah, Bormann.\" Himmler continued to look upon him from across the hall with that god-awful stare, before Bormann spoke up at last, his voice echoing across the room. \"Himmler.\" A short silence entered the room, broken by Bormann again before Himmler could say anything more. \"Traitors are everywhere in the Reich, Herr Himmler. As you know, I discovered many of these in my effort to bring justice-\" Himmler lightly chuckled at this, Bormann set into a rage immediately. \"Do you think this is funny!?\" Himmler brought himself together. \"No, no. I wouldn't dare.\"\n\nBormann noted his sarcasm, rounding to the true point of him being here. \"The Reich has been infested with red-front and reactionaries, Himmler - and the SS hasn't been implicated in traitorous activities... yet.\"  Himmler's smile slipped from his face, and with it, Bormann's own turned into a grin. \"The SS is a light for Germany in these dark times, and the public mustn't be panicked into thinking otherwise by any untowards actions against the course of justice. Understand me, Herr Himmler?\"\n\nThe room was so silent that you could hear a pin drop. After a few seconds of silence, Himmler's slightly agitated face went back to a calm form - as did his voice. \"Loud and clear, Bormann. Will that be all?\" Bormann chuckled, the atmosphere in the room easing. \"I'm afraid so. Apologies for bothering you, but now I'll rest easy knowing you understand the situation.\" Bormann opened up the large double doors behind him, exiting from whence he came - his ultimatum all but clear."
twrbormann.2.a:0 "The die is cast."
twrbormann.3.t:0 "Bormann's Speech"
twrbormann.3.d:0 "Bormann stood upon the Reichstag podium once more. As he looked upon the hall of silent Nazi Party members once again, his eyes rested for moments upon the section filled with key SS members. Himmler looked upon him in return with disdain, as did many in his row. They did not act against him... and that was all he needed.\n\n\"Honoured members of the Reichstag and the Party, I stand before you with more developments. Another day, another group of traitors found - this time, with the assistance of the honourable SS.\" Bormann motioned his hand towards the row, dissatisfied faces looking back at his own wide yet seemingly immalicious grin. \"They laid down their lives to protect Fuhrer Hitler, and they will do the same to bring those who would dare tear him down to justice. In their pursuit of the perpetrators, they have proven their absence of guilt in the face of any accusations that come their way.\"\n\nBormann looked upon the rest of the Reichstag, a noticeable number starting to be much more enthusiastic in standing at attention than before. \"There will be no stone left unturned. When I leave this world, I will leave a Reich cleansed of reactionary and red-guard filth! Dissmissed, Kamaraden - Sieg Heil!\"For the first time in what seemed like forever, the Reichstag had been forced into unity through fear. Every hand went up, every jackboot clacked against the floor and all voices bellowed one word.\n\n\"Heil!\""
twrbormann.3.a:0 "The Black Sun shines on a bloodbath."
twrbormann.4.t:0 "Himmler's Speech"
twrbormann.4.d:0 "Bormann approached the Reichstag podium, only to notice that Heinrich Himmler was already there. \"Don't be a fool, Herr Himmler...\" Bormann lightly whispered to him - only to be pushed aside to the floor. Bormann looked back up at Himmler in shock, just as the Reichstag did upon the scene of Himmler upon the podium standing over Bormann. Himmler spoke into the microphone.\n\n\"Honoured representatives and Party members, for many of you, you have never come face to face with a dishonourable despot before, as you have been surrounded by the heroes of the first generation. Herr Hitler, Goebbels, Goering - just to name a few. Well, I say this to you - you have seen a despot in the making, and that is Bormann!\" Reichstag guards prepared to escort Himmler out of the building until his SS bodyguard detail raised their rifles, forcing the lightly armed personnel to back down.\n\n\"Himmler, this is absolute madness!\" Bormann could be heard shouting, even at his distance from the microphone. Nonetheless, Himmler persisted in his speech. \"Those of you that allow this man to cut the throats of your comrades to save your own skin are traitors to the Aryan ideals upon which this nation was founded. The SS, its' personnel and I, none of us will be tools of this reactionary filth, and if you have any heart left in you - if you believe in National Socialism at all, you will follow by example and reject this madness!\"\n\nThe more outspoken of the Reichstag members cheered at Himmler's speech. Before Bormann could make a coherent response, the members of the SS and those who had cheered for Himmler's speech exited the Reichstag chamber, leaving Bormann with half the audience, half the support and a broken facade."
twrbormann.4.a:0 "The Black Sun turns its' back on the opportunist."
twrbormann.5.t:0 "An Ultimatum to the Old Guards"
twrbormann.5.d:0 "Christian Weber sat alone in his office, mindlessly brushing through the reports coming in from across the Baden area. They spoke of many things, none of which were of interest to this tired old man. He looked to the picture of his prized racehorse, smiling. If Weber had one thing left in this world that he cherished, it was his horse-racing hobby.\n\nHis reflection was broke when his guard entered his room, standing straight in front of Weber's desk and gave to him a letter stamped with the seal of the Fuhrer. His eyes opening wide for a brief moment, he dismissed the guard. As the guard exited, Weber opened up the letter and read the contents inside, just as many other of the Party Old Guard were doing all across the country.\n\n\"To the old comrades of mine - I have been taking against the hidden reactionary traitors within our ranks that dared to bring down our comrade Hitler, as you may know. Many of us walked alongside him at the Putsch, even more of us alongside his steady rise to power in the late twenties. All of us not following the tide of popularity - instead, fighting for the Universal Truth since day one.\n\nYet, here we stand more than twenty-five years later and we find that some of those that had stood alongside us all those years ago wished nothing more than to tear down the Second Revolution from the inside. It pains me to see it, and I'm sure it pains you too. However, you must support my pursuit of justice and not allow yourself to be filled with mere sentimentalities. I fight for the fate of the Reich, and I know that any friend of mine does too. If I must say goodbye to the memories of more dear friends so that Germany may stand strong, then so be it.\""
twrbormann.5.a:0 "If they know what's good for them, they will step aside."
twrbormann.6.t:0 "Fold"
twrbormann.6.d:0 "Christian Weber was a man of intrigue, class and style. Needless to say, he was savvy when it came to the world of politics, and so, he knew his decision was right. It had to be.\n\nHe sat on a table with a few of his friends, dealing poker cards. While gambling was looked down upon in the Reich, the upper echelons of the Old Guard were quite fond of it. And so, here they were -  they dealt, going round after round, wins and losses on all sides. It was turning out to be a fun night, until the door swung open with a crack and a thud. An armed detail entered the room, almost sending all of the men into a frenzy. Weber, however, stayed perfectly still.\n\nA sigh could be seen upon Weber's face as one of the nameless friends of his was read the crime of which he was accused. The most senior of the soldiers nodded to Weber - perhaps another one of the many faces he knew. Weber cracked a smile despite the situation, however soon his glum expression resumed. Before he even knew, the friend of his was being dragged out of the building and towards certain death. What he had done to incur the wrath of Bormann, Weber did not know - but maybe it was better off that way.\n\nBormann was a loose cannon not worth angering. Weber would not risk the cards he held, as would none of the other old Nazi Party members. After all, a few lives here and there were not worth stretching their necks out - sometimes it is better to fold than to risk all the chips on the table."
twrbormann.6.a:0 "Old age brings wisdom, it seems."
twrbormann.7.t:0 "Old Guards' Defiance"
twrbormann.7.d:0 "A detatchment of Ordnungspolitzei stood outside of a building in downtown Munich, where another enemy of Bormann's had been reported to have gone into hiding. The squad leader whispered to the others and gestured to breach as radio confirmation came through. The other officer nodded, kicking in the door. All of them flooded in, only for the clicking of gun hammers to be heard as the lights flashed on. What faced them were what seemed to be a paramilitary force endowed in what looked to be modernised SA uniforms aiming outdated Kar98ks back at the armed police, who had also drawn their guns. A standoff, and in the midst, Weber and the police's target, standing among the paramilitary soldiers.\n\n\"Herr Weber...?\" The policeman spoke in confusion, before affirming his voice. \"Hand over the man next to you. He has been announced as a traitor to the Reich by-\" \"Bormann?\" Weber's voice interjected, before he chuckled, as did many of the aged friends of his that surrounded him. All of them seemed to be old party members, or friends of friends - interests pooled together make for an odd combination. \"No... these men aren't traitors. Bormann needs to learn that killing the innocent does not equate to legitmacy of rule, lest he become a true tyrant.\"\n\nSilence. Twenty guns drawn and tensions high. The policeman spoke up at last. \"My orders are clear, Herr - please, hand over the man. I don't want any trouble.\" Weber and the other old Nazi party members around him chuckled. \"No, you are right. There's no need for trouble. Turn around, head back to your station. I promise you... your boss will be more than understanding of the situation.\" It took a moment to realise the implication, but it eventually clicked. \"Understood. Boys... let's head back.\"\n\nMoney and files passed hand to hand through Germany that night, and for the nights to come. More and more on the lists that Bormann wrote would find themselves unapprehended, some prisoners freed - all at the hands of the old Nazi party members and their influence. Needless to say, they picked their side. Bormann now has a lot more enemies on his chopping block, and it's a lot harder to cut off these heads than the others."
twrbormann.7.a:0 "These old fools need to learn when to step aside!"
twrbormann.8.t:0 "Exhibit A"
twrbormann.8.d:0 "Martin Bormann, pouring sweat from out under his suit, makes his way to the lower floor of the Reichstag. Every corner of the room is filled by a writhing mass of irritated men, frustrated they have to stay in this stifling makeshift courtroom for weeks to come. He motions for a lackey to bring forth the evidence against the accused. Unbeknownst to the men of the Reichstag, the lackey pushing forward the cart crammed with the evidence is also a recent hiree to the position of Bormann's personal valet. Bormann shoves his hands through the papers, arriving at a black document covered in little white spots.\n\nBormann walks up to the high commissioner of the trial, placing the document on his desk. On it, there are a series of fingerprints found on items important to the assassination. The high commissioner looks confused, so Bormann whispers him something. The commissioner calls foreward Joseph Goebbels and the second-in-commands of Albert Speer and Hermann Göring. Bormann's lackey brings foreward a tray of ink and blank parchment. Their fingerprints are compared with those on the document, and they are found to be perfect matches. They even seem a little too perfect. There are no smudges or overlapping prints. Its almost as if they were taken directly from the Reich's files.\n\nUpon the presenting of the evidence, the Reichstag has a meltdown, devolving into a great shouting match. No matter how many times the high commissioner calls for "silence!" or "order!" nooone listens. A series of fistfights break out across the mob. In order to calm things down, a guard is called foreward to shoot into the ceiling. Nobody is left happy, and the heat has only gotten worse."
twrbormann.8.a:0 "How many papers are in that cart?"
twrbormann.9.t:0 "The \"Brown Eminence\" Confronted"
twrbormann.9.d1:0 "A week had passed, and the men of the Reichstag were quick to gain access to the open air. Bormann had just finished presenting his last piece of evidence for the day, this time it was recordings of forced confessions from the underlings of Speer and Goebbels. He waited for the room to flush out, as to make sure that noone tried to tamper with his evidence. Just as the days were boiling hot, the nights were home to cold, dry flurries of wind. Once the Reichstag was emptied, Bormann completed his usual ritual, passing some money to the high commissioner and leaving behind his personal bodyguard unit to protect his evidence. Bormann slipped behind the back of Reichstag, his coat unfurled, and pulled out a cigarette to relieve his nerves. Just as he did so, he saw something beyond the bushes, and behind the columns. Perhaps it was just his mind playing tricks on him? He wasn't about to take the chance. He began making his way back towards the entrance of the Reichstag.\n\nHe had just started moving away when a strange sight caught his eye. A posse of men, some wearing black uniforms with the SS insignia, others wearing mismatched SA attire or civilian clothes, walked up to him in unison. They ran up to Bormann, one man sticking a rifle into Bormann's chest while an SS officer pulled out a document covered in scrawled writing. The officer spoke, \"following an analysis by the SS of your deeds, both inside and outside of the trial being conducted within the Reichstag, the SS has come to the conclusion that you...\" One of the men, not of the SS, began punching Bormann in the throat. The officer breathed in, remarking \"just arrest him\" before strutting off. The men that night, the ones not in the SS, were nothing more than mercenaries. Bormann knew, the only political faction that didn't have the military connections to use their own soldiers were the Old Guards. It was stunning really, two of the most opposed groups in Germany coming together to depose him. Unfortunately for Bormann, he was knocked out and dragged away before he had the time to appreciate the irony. His bodyguard unit came looking, but there was nothing to find.\n\nThe men of the Reichstag were relieved to hear the trial had ended, but also terrified. What would this mean for the state of Germany if a man as powerful as Bormann could just be arrested without opposition? They waited, breath bated, for the next move to be made."

He could recognize their insignia, they were members of the SS. A pair of three, two soldiers, one officer, walked up to Bormann. One of the soldiers lifted a gun to his forehead, the other walked behind and placed on him handcuffs. The officer pulled out a document, on it was a paragraph, followed by lines of scrawled writing. The officer spoke, \"following an analysis by the SS of your deeds, both inside and outside of the trial being conducted within the Reichstag, the SS has come to the conclusion that you, Martin Ludwig Bormann, are attempting to destabilize the German Reich by persecuting its most capable commanders through fabricated evidence which you have used your extensive connections to gain a hold of. We, therefore, will be placing you under arrest, and will be analyzing further the evidence you have presented in search of forgery, coercion, falsification, corruption, or any other means by which you have attempted to manipulate the Reich's system of justice.\" Bormann struggled at first, even pushing away the soldier attempting to place on him handcuffs, but he eventually relented, his last hope that his bodyguard unit would leave the Reichstag in search of him. They never did, although there was a small shootout once the SS attempted to seize Bormann's evidence. His unit surrendered upon hearing of his capture.\n\nThe men of the Reichstag were relieved to hear the trial had ended, but also terrified.

The man who had been kicking Bormann stood up straight, breathed in, and spoke \"You are under arrest for use of forged evidence.\" He then held up his rifle with both hands, and beat in the back of Bormann's head with the rifle's stock until Bormann passed out. These men were not of any organization, but mercenaries of others who lacked the military connections necessary to get soldiers to do their bidding, the Old Guard.

twrbormann.10.d:0 "After a lengthy show trial, the conspirators have been executed. Those that stood were accused of conspiring to kill Adolf Hitler. The conspirators were hanged by the neck at dawn. Some were visibly tired and haggard as they marched to the gallows. They were undoubtedly exhausted by the psychological torture used to extract their confession. Others wore a bitter and furious grimace. One made his indignence with the show trial known when he attempted suicide the morning of the final hearing. He hadn't even tied the noose off when the bailiff came by to retrieve him. The Führer would not allow the disgraced party members to die that easily."

twrbormann.11.d:0 "In Martin Bormann's Germany, blood is not thicker than water. This grim new reality was clarified by the announcement today that Bormann's younger brother Albert has been arrested for \"treasonous activities\". His detainment is the latest one in a series of purges carried out by the elder Bormann to consolidate his control over the NSDAP. Until now, Albert has led a quiet but productive career as an adjutant in the Führer's Chancellery and an officer in the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSSK), where he rose to the rank of Obergruppenführer. It was assumed by all who knew him that he was en route to becoming the NSSK's new Korpsführer, but his detainment has put his career on hold.\n\nAmid a string of high-profile accusations, Albert's arrest has puzzled observers. Albert is by all accounts a reserved and dutiful party acolyte. The crimes brought against him are incongruous with both his character and his professional record, given that he was a trusted associate of the previous Führer.\n\nThis may in fact be the reason for Albert's fall from grace. He accumulated too much power for Martin's liking. The personal animosity between the Bormanns has long been common knowledge among the Reich's bureaucrats. Although they'd never say it out loud, they know that the cold and self-obsessed Martin is jealous of Albert's humbleness and amicability."

It has come to light that Albert Speer and Joseph Goebbels, two of Hitler's closest confidants, have been arrested for their complicity in the 1948 coup. Following a minor stroke that left Hitler incapacitated, Speer and Goebbels are said to have conspired to overthrow him with the aid of several officers. In a televised speech, successor Führer Martin Bormann announced that documentary evidence had emerged confirming Speer and Goebbels' treachery. With the trials set to commence without delay, Bormann declared that there would be \"no clemency\" for those who act against the interests of the Reich and her people.\n\nEven amid the turbulence of the 1950's, these developments have shaken the Reich to its very core. Its internal politics have been fraught with tension at the best of times, but these are not the best of times. People whisper to one another in private about the dubious reliability of the incriminating documents. Rumors have abounded that the arrest of Bormann's rivals is merely a prelude to a party-wide culling. Little is certain about the future except that old scores are going to be settled. The fog of fear and paranoia that perpetually hangs over Germania has grown ever more opaque. If party titans like Speer and Goebbels aren't safe, then who is?"

Their number was unclear as his ears rang from the shouts inside his cell as his jailor had read to him the final judgement passed to him. They had put a sack on his head, roughed him up but he cared no more.\n\nIn a flash he saw his life before him once more, from his childhood in Mannheim, in the house his father had designed, already continuing the craft of his father in turn. And he had continued the tradition, but of his own accord. He wanted to design not simple buildings but glorious monuments, plazas and statues to the indomitable German spirit. Alas he joined organizations that embodied just that, ideologues that emphasized the cultivation of the body and spirit, to purge the unclean and festering parasite plaguing the body and finally the German would rise and take his rightful throne atop Europe and the world.\n\nThen he had met the painter and with that his fate was sealed, he followed him into the echelons of power after the death of the Weimar Republic and through the inferno of war. They won, and with the painter's vision fulfilled, he made his reality too. Berlin was reborn as Germania, with him at the helm, a city of his design alone.\n\nThen the painter was gone and he was cast adrift once more, he had gambled big, even joined forces with that orator. And lose they did all. So he stood in the cold, eyes in darkness, body bruised. Bound against the wall. Before him stood a column of soldiers, rifles ready. Maybe the accursed secretary was watching, maybe not. It mattered not all the same."

twrbormann.14.t:0 "A World Fallen Silent"
twrbormann.14.d:0 "The orator was dragged out of his cell, as fate wanted it no last meal nor holy sermon was administered to him. Not that he would have had any use for it beyond borrowing him time. His executioners were plenty, all trained and loyal to the secretary. He didn't even look at his final judge's face as he read the death warrant to him. No reaction on his part. Words were of no use to him anymore.\n\nHe went up the stairs to the gallow, only focusing on that dreaded noose ahead. He did not know how many people were around him. He did not know whether the architect was next in line. He did not know whether the architect had come to watch his final moments. It mattered not to him. Instead he used what little time he had left to reminisce of a world he had filled, in his mind, so wonderfully with sound and imagery, a land and world he shaped with his voice and the millions in whose ears his echo would ring long after he was gone.\n\nHe remembered his childhood, a disability that made the world cast him out, only to lighten in him the aspiration to make it truly his, the glorious battles of the great war he praised as he was granted the privilege to hold his years valediction. The void he was plunged into as glorious Germany lost, humiliated and defeated he lay broken like his country, his juvenile catholic faith collapsing. Him drifting through the country and years as he lacked vision and belonging. Stoking in him bitter hatred for what he saw as evils root. Then he found his belonging. He met the old general and the father of the hammer and sword. Both now distant memories. Then he met the painter. At first he was dismissive of him, his vision so fundamentally different from his. But then he saw the painter's glory. He became one of his foremost disciples and he saw that the painter's, now his, vision, was realized. He rallied the people of Germany, he saw that they recognized the rot and parasites in their midst.\n\nThey had won the war and his voice echoed across the world, now urging the Aryan on to take the rest of the world, once Russia was fully subjugated, the accursed pope would hang, the eagles wings clipped. Only that secretary had seen otherwise, forcing him to ally with that damnable architect, an opportunist almost like the War Hero. They had lost. He closed his eyes."
twrbormann.14.a:0 "The noose tightened and the world fell silent."
twrbormann.15.t:0 "Secret Detente With Germany?"
twrbormann.15.d:0 "The United States has always been a bastion of freedom and we have therefore been seen as liberators by the oppressed peoples of Europe, from our revolution to the War of 1812, to the Civil war and the Great War. While that is certainly true and will continue to be, a recent turn of events may very well change that, as Germany is proposing a secret treaty which will lead to a maintaining of the status quo.\n\nIn this treaty the Germans led by Fuhrer Martin Bormann propose that if we cease all military actions in Europe and do not intervene in the areas of interest of Germany then they would be willing to give an end to all of their further expansions in and outside of Europe. While this may seem as a \"too good to be true\" deal and some are suspicious of its authenticity, Bormann is a man willing to maintain the status quo. The main issue with this is what will happen if anyone finds out of this as it could very well lead to the US and the world being set ablaze as we would be seen as the villain in this situation. Only the highest in government around the president know of this and as the army fumes at the news of the president even considering such a thing other members see it as a general way of preventing any future conflicts."

twrbormann.21.t:0 "The Death of Albert Bormann"
twrbormann.21.d:0 "It was announced today that Albert Bormann, the Führer's younger brother, has been found dead in his prison cell. It was discovered after he didn't emerge from his cell for the morning roll-call that he'd ingested a cyanide capsule the previous night. All available evidence indicates that he committed suicide, perhaps out of shame over the charges brought against him. The prison guards hadn't checked on Albert since the previous evening and were at a loss to explain where the capsule had come from.\n\nDespite the Führer's Chancellery's insistence to the contrary, rumors are circulating that foul play was at work in Albert's death. While it's most likely that Albert did indeed kill himself, it appears there was more going on than what the state news network has revealed. Like the vanquished Sturmabteilung leader Ernst Röhm, it's possible Albert was offered the choice of suicide as an alternative to the humiliation and eventual execution that would come with his treason trial. Whatever the case may have been, one fact is now certain. The new Führer will not tolerate insubordination, be it from his party acquaintances or his own flesh and blood."
twrbormann.21.a:0 "Few things are as heavy as a death in the family."
twrbormann.22.t:0 "The Traitorous Jews"
twrbormann.22.d:0 "As proclaimed by Martin Bormann himself, all political traitors from now on will be recognized as \"spiritually Jewish\", qualifying them for the worst punishments that the Reich has to offer.\n\nWhile the normal citizen has "nothing to fear", Martin Bormann have been using this punishment liberally, settling his old scores directly with this method. Many past enemies of Bormann are now either secretly fleeing or have went into hiding, trying their best to avoid Bormann's wrath."
twrbormann.22.a:0 "All of these people are jews."
twrbormann.23.t:0 "Illegal Doubts"
twrbormann.23.d:0 "As doubts began to surface about Bormann's claims, a special committee has been formed. Referred as "The Committee of National Socialist Thoughts", a powerful group that has the right to punish \"Non-National Socialistic Thoughts\", which includes disagreeing with Bormann's accusations that Adolf Hitler was murdered by a ring of traitors.\n\nThousands are now wanted and will be questioned by this committee, and Martin Bormann has issued an directive, ordering the police to cooperate fully with the functions of the committee."

twrbormann.24.a:0 "Oh no..."
twrbormann.25.t:0 "Future of the Regime"
twrbormann.25.d:0 "As the ministers gathered themselves, the future of regime remains uncertain. More and more Germans are now unsatisfied about how politicians are functioning, with power struggles greatly damaging the nation's development.\n\nIn the eyes of some, the age of traditional politics must come to an end."

twrbormann.27.d:0 "Since Bormann's fall from grace, he is now nothing but a former politician. However, the new regime must decide on what to do with this traitor.\n\nThe majority of the people are calling for his execution, but a number of ministers are calling for Bormann's life to be spared, since these ministers were the ones assigned by Bormann himself."

twrbormann.28.t:0 "New Leadership"
twrbormann.28.d:0 "As the cabinet regained its composure, a new leader must now be picked.\n\nTasked with the duty of gathering the pieces, this new leader must be capable of calming the government, but the rounds of purges have rendered Germany shortage on actual competent politicians."

twrbormann.28.c:0 "Gerhard Klopfer."
twrbormann.29.t:0 "Burning the Evidences"
twrbormann.29.d:0 "As Bormann's hit squads marched into several government departments, they ravaged their archives, snipping through tons of documents, then packed the neccessary ones into little boxes. These documents were then put on a truck and transported to a secretive location.\n\nBormann's thugs arranged these documents in a massive pile, then set it ablaze. Within minutes, thousands of written documentations were disintegrated, with the information within them lost forever. Nobody really knows the true contents of these destroyed documents, but one thing is for certain - this action has greatly benefited Martin Bormann in one shape or the other."
twrbormann.29.a:0 "Burn it all."
twrbormann.30.t:0 "Executing the Witnesses"
twrbormann.30.d:0 "On an unexpecting night, the staff of Hitler's residence were rounded up and escroted to a remote location by Bormann's thugs. First, they were interrogated by special investigators of Bormann, with the ultimate goal of extracting as much information as possible from them. And then, these people were blindfolded and executed on the spot.\n\nHundreds were executed in this operation, most of them were servants and staff of the residence, with a handful of them being Wehrmacht soldiers stationed near the residence. However, Eva Braun was not questioned by Bormann, but is now under heavy surveillance for potential spy activities."
twrbormann.30.a:0 "The dead tells no tale."
twrbormann.31.t:0 "Executing the Doctors"
twrbormann.31.d:0 "The doctors that were assigned to look after the Führer failed miserably at their task. Martin Bormann has declared this team of medical workers as enemies of the Reich, calling them \"traitors and caused the Führer's demise.\"\n\nBormann's thugs quickly arrested these people, and sentenced them to death in a kangaroo court. All of their possessions have been confiscated by the state, which includes a mountain of medical documents. Nobody knows what is the purpose of these executions, but Bormann is surely satisfied with the death of these incompetent professionals."
twrbormann.31.a:0 "They deserved it."
twrbormann.411.t:0 "Intimidation Failed"
twrbormann.411.d:0 "Even with our thugs, the opposition remained stubborn, refusing to submit to our demands.\n\nWe must handle these troublesome elements until they become a major problem of the regime's stability."
twrbormann.411.a:0 "Damnation!"
twrbormann.32.t:0 "Time of Choosing"
twrbormann.32.d:0 "For the leadership, it is now prime time for Bormann to truly cement his position in Germany.\n\nThere are a number of ways to do this, Bormann can either approach the Americans in secret, or continue his schemes and plots behind Germany's back."
twrbormann.32.a:0 "We should try to talk with the Yankees!"
twrbormann.32.b:0 "We must play it safe."
twrbormann.33.t:0 "Bormann Executed"
twrbormann.33.d:0 "\"PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T KILL ME. I'LL DO ANYTHING, JUST TAKE THIS BAG OFF MY-\"\n\nThose were the final words of one Martin Bormann, Fuhrer of the Greater Germanic Reich and leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party. Bormann died in much the same way he lived, in the most pathetic form he could have managed. Bormann has been recently disposed of his position as Fuhrer via an internal coup. Frustrated with the weak leadership demonstrated by him, the coup plotters thought it best to simply put Bormann up against the wall. He will be given an unmarked grave somewhere in the backwoods of the Rhineland, and Germany will now be able to move one from his astounding incompetence."
twrbormann.33.a:0 "There goes the bastard."
twrbormann.34.t:0 "Bormann Goes Missing"
twrbormann.34.d:0 "Paparazzi struggle through crowds of their own to fling questions at the prison governor, questions that invariably go unanswered. Germany's grey eminence is at last behind bars and out of power, but as long as he is here, he will never be at peace. The new regime has determined that he be given a public trial, or at least as public as is suitable for a political criminal, and so the lists of interview requests pile up without end. Martin Bormann is resting, or he is taciturn, or perhaps the administration simply wishes to ignore his existence until he can be dragged out and destroyed one last time. \n\nAs the nation fixates on the prison walls, the guard is doubled, and then tripled. The prison guards have no intention of failing with the eyes of Germania upon them, and so barbed wire is erected at a distance of a few metres outside the prison. The guards are given semiautomatic rifles and codewords, to ensure no sympathisers make their way into the prison unannounced. The prison itself turns into an archipelago of forts, each with their own captives. In a publicised announcement the week before the trial, the prison governor announces that Bormann is \"untouchable\".\n\nAnd so he is. The night before the trial, Bormann fails to respond to his dinner call, and then to roll-call, and when the guards burst into the cell room fearing suicide they find something entirely more shocking."

twrbormann.35.d:0 "In the vast and lonely expanse of Patagonia, two men are walking down a damp coastline at night. It had rained the afternoon before, and everything still carries with it a sort of aqueous scent. The sand at their feet felt malleable and flimsy in its foundation, like a sauce in the process of being made. They can hardly see what lies in front of them, as their lanterns do not provide a great deal of light, but in distance, they can discern a faint sparkle. It seems as though something is reflecting the light of their lanterns back towards them.\n\nThey decide to investigate it further.\n\nWhen they come upon the source of this reflection, they find a long steel tube, studded with a wide variety of windows and bolts. It is unlike anything they have ever seen before, this vessel of another world. At first, they are unsure of what to do with it, and simply remain frozen in place. When one of the men finally finds the wherewithal to approach it for better inspection, they hear a hatch open on its topside.\n\nOut of the hatch emerges out a large, round, shadowy figure. The men turn to point their lanterns directly at the figure, only to find that it is clad in an innumerable amount of medals and ribbons. In this moment they can also take a look at his face, paggered and completely exhausted. By reorienting their gaze slightly, the men can also discern a bright, red armband.\n\nBefore they have the chance to say anything, the man speaks at them, in a chipped and broken Spanish.\n\n\"My name is Martin Bormann, please take me to the nearest town\""

At 1500 Berlin time, the Reichstag revealed Bormann's formal execution under charges of treason, charges that surprised nobody in the international press. The reaction in the German press has been muted by gag-orders imposed from Germania, as well as a general sense of defeat for the Centrist-Fascist supporters gathered under the former Secretary's wing.\n\nThe German Government has refused to release pictures of his corpse, shrouding his death in mystery. Conspiracy theorists around the world are already speculating that the would-be Fuhrer is in fact hiding in South America, waiting for the promised time to deliver Germany back into the Hitlerian embrace."
