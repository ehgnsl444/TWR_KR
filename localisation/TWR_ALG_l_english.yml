 algeria.0.t:0 "Independence Protests in Algiers"
 algeria.0.d:0 "Only a few days after the start of the Morrocan War, protests have started to appear in Algiers. Hundreds of locals have begun gathering in the capital, demanding an independent and sovereign Algeria. Tensions keep rising with the understaffed and underequipped garrison being pushed to its limits. We will have to wait and see how things turn out."

 #Leaders
 ALG_Mhidi:0 "Since the death of Messali Hadj, Larbi Ben M'hidi has become the leader of the most prominent independence group in Algeria, the Front de Libération Algérienne. Born in a village outside the city of Constantine, M'hidi gained a French education before becoming affiliated with the Algerian independence movement. A charismatic and dedicated operative, he worked directly in Oran itself before his expanding importance saw him establish the FLA in the wake of Hadj's murder by paramilitary vigilantes. Radicalized by the increasing brutality of the French State in the region, M'hidi has not shied away from violence. Massacres are met by massacres, and for every mosque torn down, the FLA has destroyed two churches. To M'hidi, the war in Algeria has been going for years. It has simply entered a new stage. The moment word arrived that his forces were in place, M'hidi took action. No more would operation be done under the cloak of night, agents dressed in civilian garb, walking the streets beneath a French flag. Algiers was siezed in a massive uprising, the tricolour torn down as the FLA's banner was sent up every flag pole. Across the coast, FLA operatives have done the same, battling against retreating military garrisons who flock to Oran. M'hidi knows that Pieds-Noirs cannot be allowed to gather strength there; the enemy must be destroyed immediately, so that a truly Algerian nation can be born, the French sent packing across the Mediterranean. His increasing nativism, pragmatic retreat on socalist economics, and distrust of non-Arabs has driven radical communists away, giving M'hidi a second enemy. This is of no concern for M'hidi. No matter the cost, no matter the foe, Algeria will be free."
 ALG_Lacoste:0 "A Frenchman from Azerat, a civil servant and an ardent socialist, Robert Lacoste was once a member of the Resistance. Like so many others, he attempted to flee to the Free French holdings, but quickly found it was an unwelcome place for socialists, and he saw little chance of victory so far from France. Returning to France to attempt reform from within, Lacoste would move to Algeria after no less than eight attempts on his life. Again he found himself in hostile territory, persecuted by the anti-communist policies. Following numerous communists, be they French, Pied-Noir, Arab, or Berber, Lacoste fled into the frontier, living amongst the oases and shantytowns at the edge of the Sahara. They set up communes, and began planning a resistance against the government, even creating an information network that would reach across the Sahara to the Free French and across the Mediterranean to the RFL. Now that Algeria has errupted into war, the communists have acted. The Algerian Communist Party seeks to create a socialist republic where all people's will live in harmony. Having 'Algerianised' himself, adopting numerous native customs and becoming fluent in Arabic, Lacoste has become a leader of the Europeans within the Party and in the frontier communes. Officially, the Party and the Revolutionary Executive Council lead the Barbary People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, but Lacoste has, through a contentious vote, been named Presiding Officer of that council. More importantly, the PDRA's enemies see him as its leader. Ben M'hidi's FLA sees him as a white colonizer, another Frenchmen seeking to rule Algeria, while Jouhaud in Oran sees him as a race traitor, a madman gone native. Lacoste is unperturbed by these accusations, and seeks nothing less than to create a free Algeria for all who would call it home."
 ALG_Sahara:0 "The French State's rule in North Africa has had its focus on Algeria and the coast, and funding for its colonial empire shrunk with every passing year. The deserts were seen as fairly worthless, a zone to avoid beyond the odd expedition for resources. A natural buffer against the Free French, the local groups and nomads have been allowed to do as they please, creating their own network of alliances, and even having their own conflicts all with little intervention or interest from Paris. In a way, the locals had grown to see their situation as advantageous, as they had effective autonomy in most respects. Once chaos erupted in Algiers, the people of the Sahara realized that their way of life was becoming jeopardized. The Council of Sahara is an officilization of the tenuous alliance network established by the Sahrawi, Haratin, Tauregs, Ishelhien, and other Mahgrebi peoples. The Tauregs are the most dominant group, but all major ethnicities have a voting member in the Council, which is truly little more than a defensive alliance to prevent the situation in Algeria from destablizing the region, or, worse, allowing the French Authority to creep in and lay claim to their lands. Lacking much vision beyond maintaing the status quo, the Council meets to try and determine the future for the Sahara and its peoples."
 ALG_Jouhaud:0 "A descendant of some of the earliest French pioneers to descend from Limoges to Algeria, Edmond Jouhaud is the pinnacle of a Pied-Noir. Always did he believe in the right of France to control the land, and he was a model officer for many years. Initially, he fought with the Resistance against the German-backed Vichy regime. However, lacking respect for the Free French under De Gaulle, Jouhaud eventually became one of the many French military men who accepted Petain's pardon. Reinstated as Inspector General of the Air Force in French North Africa, Jouhaud would eventually be named governor general of Algeria in 1951. Critical of the Weygand regime, and unhappy with the influence of Germany in France, Jouhaud has focused on turning Algeria into a haven for patriotic Frenchmen. Jouhaud has welcomed numerous settlers to the region. While many discontents and undesirable elements arrived, many more enthusiastic patriots came as well. However, given that these settlers came to escape the depressive atmosphere of Metropolitan France, a distinct Pied-Noir identity has continued to thrive, guided by Jouhaud. Once the situation in Algiers destabilized and the natives revolt began, Jouhaud rallied the military garrison and the paramilitary Organisation Armée Pied-Noir (OAP). These forces fell back to Oran, which has the highest concentration of white settlement. Seeing the Parisian government as unable to help, Jouhaud has declared the Oran Free State, with himself as its President-Généralissime. While he dreams to reconquer Algeria for France, Jouhaud's primary concern is securing the safety of the Pieds-Noirs from radicals and terrorists."

 #Events
 algeria.1.t:0 "The Algerian War of Independence"
 algeria.1.d:0 "With the start of the Morrocan war for independence, the people of Algeria began to show signs of unrest. With French colonial rule having faultered deeply since the state of France was turned into a Nazi puppet state, Algeria and many other French colonies were barely held under control through the usage of violence and oppression. But with the rise of the Morrocans, the domino effect of anti-colonialism started. \n\nA few days after the Morrocans took up arms, mass protests broke out in Algiers, with the natives under the guidance of the Front de libération nationale demanding for Algerian independence and for the exit of French forces from Algeria. In Algiers, the protests were met with gunfire from the French Algiers Garrisson, igniting the flame of violent uprising, with protestors rushing and fighting head on any French or Collaborator force they found, arming themselves. \n\nIn many cities and towns, militia have formed waving the flag of Algeria, ready to fight against their colonial overlords. But the French colonists responded to this by arming themselves with the stockpiles of the Garissons in Oran. Siding with the Oran and the Algiers Garissons, the french 'Delta Force' militia have declared that Algeria will remain French. \n\nIn the south, the Saharan tribes, left with little to no supervision by the French, united into the Saharan Council, declared neutrality from the conflict, lacking military forces, resources or motive to get into a war that might cost them the glimpse of independence they have gained."

 algeria.2.t:0 "The Barbary Red Army Seizes the Algerian Interior"
 algeria.2.d:0 "\n\nAs negotiations broke down with the Republic of Algeria, communist French Resistance fighters under the leadership of Robert Lacoste have sized the inner areas of the Algerian countryside. While stopping short of the Saharan Frontiers, these forces have reorganized themselves as the Barbary People's Republic, and have publicly declared themselves as the legitimate government. The state then demanded that the Oran Free State and Republic of Algeria stand down immediately in order to allow for the establishment of a provisional government. Neither side has accepted to the demands, and are currently mobilizing to deal with the contender."
 algeria.2.a:0 "For a truly independent Algeria!"
 algeria.2.b:0 "We must protect our National Revolution!"
 algeria.3.t:0 "The Algerian War"
 algeria.3.d:0 "With the start of the Moroccan War any semblance of order within the French overseas possession of Algeria has been shattered. A Republic of Algeria was declared by the Algerian Liberation Front, an organization notorious for their terrorist activities in pursuit of freedom, securing the majority of the coastal regions, while in the central Sahara multiple tribal factions have formed the Council of the Sahara, a coalition built primarily to resist takeover by the French Authority to the south. The remaining French forces under the Pied-Noir Defense Force have concentrated themselves in Oran, declaring the Oran Free State with the support of the large proportion of French settlers in the region. With reports of skirmishes already coming in from the front lines, international observers remain unsure of the potential victor in the conflict."
 algeria.3.a:0 "The die are cast"
 algeria.4.t:0 "End of the Algerian War"
 algeria.4.d1:0 "For the first time in over a century, the people of Algeria find themselves able to rule over themselves once more. With near unanimous native support, the Republic of Algeria was able to defeat the Oran Free State and Barbary People's Republic to secure a newly independent Algerian State. The Toronto Accord has already recognized the nation while Germany and France have made no official comment as of yet on the matter. While it is unclear as to what form of government will be developed by the Republic, or who will lead it, this has not stopped the wave of euphoria engulfing the nation, as thousands take to the streets of Algiers to celebrate the historic occasion."
 algeria.4.d2:0 "In a surprising turn of events the Oran Free State has been able to reestablish control over Algeria. While the Free State was overwhelmingly run by the minority Pied-Noir, their superior equipment and training proved to be decisive in their triumph, with all remaining rebel units being forced underground hoping to organize continued resistance. While victorious on the front, it is unknown if the state will be sustainable in the long term, as the inevitable resistance from native Algerians will require a significant investment of resources to either resolve or suppress this opposition. It is also unknown as to how the nation plans to conduct itself with respect to France and Germany, and whether or not they will assert their independence, or work for reintegration with mainland France."
 algeria.4.d3:0 "Hardened by decades of persecution and resistance, the Barbary People's Republic has been able to overcome the impossible, and establish an independent communist state. While the Toronto Accord has made no statement on the matter, the governments of France and Germany have both denounced the new nation, and have threatened to intervene as soon as possible. The BPR, unlike the other factions of the Algerian War, wishes to bring communism to the entirety of mainland France and her colonies, rather then simply establishing an independent Algeria. Their leader Robert Lacoste, has now declared their victory as the beginning of a New French Revolution, and that their victory over the collaborators is all but immanent with the current turmoil the country finds itself in. Weather or not he stands on the right side of history is yet to be seen."

 algeria.5.t:0 "The Oran Question"
 algeria.5.d:0 "With the Oran Free State victory in the war, the Frenchman can now call dominion over Algeria once again - a home away from home as they say. However, while the Oran Free State has in fact done a miraculous job at defending our interests and we have no doubt about their military cunning, they are an otherwise unstable regime politicly, since regardless of their valour - that shall not sustain the respect of the Algerian. 'Thus is why President- Généralissime Edmond Jouhand has approached the French State, offering his fealty once again to Paris and inviting French forces to reinforce the regime in Algeria. Now while it would be most desirable to embrace the Pied-Noirs back into the fold, practically speaking it may not be ideal. For occupation would be a costly affair, perhaps outweighing the actual monetary and strategic value of Algeria. Theoretically we could still reap the benefits even when casting them astray, but their lack of stability may make their continued existence unsustainable and prone to another insurgency without our support. How should we approach this controversial matter?"
