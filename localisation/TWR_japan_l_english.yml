And Japan is not much different, yet with our blade taken from us and our body still wracked by the previous war, our pursuit must be of spiritual nature rather than physical one.

But no one knows if this is a stable, or even desirable, situation - who knows when the Americans will leave, and what will replace them as a domestic engine of growth? If Japan is ever to turn itself into a strong and stable power, it must first reinvent itself economically, for where our soldiers cannot go - our convoys will have to venture."

 JAP_Utilizing_Foreign_Aid_desc:0 "The Co-Prosperity Sphere, despite the best intentions of our Pan-Asian theorists, could never separate itself from inevitable claims of colonial exploitation (which were, for the most part, true). But in defeat, we have been freed from the pretence that we do not need foreign support for our own economy - American foreign aid, intended to bolster us as a strategic bulwark against Chinese aggression and a support for the Russian Republic, kept us financially viable as we rebuilt the cities and ports.\n\nThe American investment is drying up, but their World Bank and International Monetary Fund are only too willing to bridge the gap. Loans from the World Bank, to the sum of 40 million dollars, will buffer our domestic investments in infrastructure repair - if we must lean on the West to rebuild, we will swallow our pride until we can stand as equals with them."

 JAP_Purchasing_Tech_desc:0 "Since the Tokugawa era Japan has been running after the rest of the world's technology: what the West invents, Japan buys, and what Japan buys Japan then reverse-engineers. We will replicate this process in the next decade with the heavy industrial technologies that made America unstoppable in war and unbeatable in peace: if America can manufacture everything from toys to tanks, we would be foolish not to learn at their feet.\n\nMassive-scale subsidisation of private-sector imports of these technologies will keep our small and medium enterprises competitive with the firms of China and the Asia-Pacific. A little ‘helping hand' from their larger, dominant brethren will also ensure that these companies remain competitive in resource assets, in exchange for their entering the orbit of the Zaibatsus in what we might call a system-conglomerate. A Keiretsu, to use the proper Kanji."
 JAP_Attract_Oversea_Corporations:0 "Attracting Overseas Corporations"
 JAP_Attract_Oversea_Corporations_desc:0 "The central mistake of our economic theorists was assuming that the Japanese economy could withstand a prolonged period of isolation from the outside world - we were terribly wrong, and we have paid the price for our mistake many times over. Our national economy is slowly recovering at the behest of the Americans, and now we must look to the rest of the world for the investment and employment that they alone cannot provide.\n\nOur key strength is our unique mix of state-led growth and private industry - the Zaibatsus were shaken by the War, but they were not quite broken, and they have always been deeply tied with the public sector. With a little retrofitting of our pre-war economic infrastructure, the Zaibatsus will be our biggest weapon in reducing production costs - and where the money is cheap, the companies of the West will follow."
 JAP_Retrofit_the_War_Economy:0 "Retrofit the War Economy"
 JAP_Retrofit_the_War_Economy_desc:0 "In response to rising demand-side pressures for equipment, weaponry and other wartime goods, the Japanese zaibatsus created something unique: a wholly private entity guided by the state and directed to produce in certain areas more than in others, and yet otherwise autonomous. This enabled the war effort to go on for far longer than we had initially believed was possible, and the militarization of our citizens' private life was a welcome side-effect.\n\nThe time has come to rebuild this same spirit of profit and sacrifice. We will begin rolling back the corporate-control laws introduced by the Americans, centralizing powers over manpower, material inputs and access to infrastructure in the hands of the Zaibatsus. And as the factories begin to spew out consumer goods instead of guns, they will do so at a frightening speed."
 JAP_The_Global_Contractor:0 "The Global Contractor"
 JAP_The_Global_Contractor_desc:0 "Where the global economy goes, Japan must now follow - and it speaks only the language of profit. The new rules of the game are simple: we must produce at as low a cost as possible and in as high a quantity as necessary, and we will win. Our allies in Siberia, who rely on our developed industry to maintain their armies, and our American garrison are also an opportunity begging to be grasped.\n\nThis is the plan: while Ford, Boeing, General Motors and the conglomerates of the West can produce goods domestically, they can be persuaded to subcontract the production of individual components to ship across the Pacific if the price is right. We shall spare no expense (well, we will spare every possible expense) to ensure that they are seduced into collaboration with us. Japan's future depends upon it."
 JAP_Japanese_Dockyards:0 "Japanese Dockyards"
 JAP_Japanese_Dockyards_desc:0 "Where goods go, ships follow - the Shogunate knew it and so do we. The rise of commercial shipping in the last half-century has incentivised the creation of a new breed of ship, the commercial freighter, built to maximise shipping intake and minimize cost of each individual shipment. Large, bulky and extremely profitable, they are the future of international trade - and we are woefully unequipped for their arrival.\n\nThe upgrading of our dockyard facilities in major cities like Tokyo, Nagoya, Sapporo, Yokohama and Kobe will ensure that these hulks can fit into our shipyards and our ports, clearing the way to convenient and profitable mass exports. Further research into dockyard equipment will enable us to handle shipping containers safely and efficiently, which should reduce all those quality complaints our manufacturers are receiving..."
 JAP_The_New_Power_Grid:0 "The New Power Grid"
 JAP_The_New_Power_Grid_desc:0 "We can build factories that reach the clouds above Tokyo itself, but they will not function without the power generation infrastructure to keep them going. This simple fact crippled our wartime industry and naval capabilities, and we would be wise to learn a lesson from the experience: a Japan without electricity is a Japan on life support.\n\nOur generator facilities do have one advantage - they are adept at heat control, allowing our usage of heavy oil to power domestic electricity grids with high efficiency. We will sponsor the transition from coal to heavy oil to exploit this, ensuring that our costs of power generation will be greatly lowered, and further the electrification of rural Japan to aid domestic small and medium industry."
 JAP_Starting_The_Oil_Industry:0 "Starting the Oil Industry"
 JAP_Starting_The_Oil_Industry_desc:0 "Our refineries and oil-production facilities have always been our Achilles' heel - as the pipelines from Indonesia ran dry and our ventures into Malaya failed, the oil that fuelled Japan was becoming scarce even before the Americans bombed us into oblivion. In this great disaster, however, came opportunity. We have been forced to start afresh, creating domestic oil production and refinement facilities that are now civilian-oriented and more efficient than our pre-war counterparts.\n\nWe will sponsor oil refineries in strategic regions close to our major cities, with generous import subsidies in return for low cost-prices for our oil importers. The hiring of foreign experts from America and Europe will further ease our burdens, and hopefully inspire the adoption of new techniques in our own commercial counterparts."

We were once a major manufacturer and a hub of secondary industry, before we turned the factory-lines to the purpose of making tanks and aircraft. With our domestic security more or less guaranteed, we can focus our efforts on making Japanese manufacturing a global brand and a bulwark of production against China and the Soviets.\n\nThe Zaibatsus tell us that we are ready for the transition back to full-scale manufacturing: fat with foreign cash, high on capital loans and flush with material asset injections, the Zaibatsus have begun expansion beyond their prewar levels of production. An additional set of negotiations for raw material inputs will jumpstart the Years of Growth, and from there - the sky is the limit."
 JAP_Japanese_Steelworks:0 "Japanese Steelworks"
 JAP_Japanese_Steelworks_desc:0 "Our privately managed steelworks once produced the backbone of an Empire - but even if our territorial acquisitions have vanished, the network of collaborative enterprise that fed them has not. Steel production in Japan retains much of the Zaibatsu style of management, characterised by tacit or implicit inter-firm collaboration to maximise profit structures. This has already created something of a boom within the steel industry, due to high international demand from our friends in Siberia and domestic demand during Reconstruction.\n\nWe need only encourage this positive state of affairs by sponsoring informal firm-firm arrangements, adopting the Mass Oxygen Furnace across the industry and sourcing for cheap material inputs in North America and China. When our steel industry is fully mature, we will have plentiful material bases to begin our real work in consumer products."

 JAP_Developing_the_Automobile_Industry_desc:0 "If the Japanese home is the new castle of the working man, the car is his trusty steed - a vital symbol of consumer culture and affluence, demand for a truly proletarian car has only grown as our nation rises to prosperity. The development of fully domestically-devoted car industries is clear proof that we are a nation destined to take to the highways, and the rapid expansion of our automobile firms like Mitsubishi and Toyota only proves this.\n\nFurther relaxations in car sales within the country itself, and the accelerated adoption of technology and methods from Western carmakers, will turn our automotive industry into something that is truly cutting-edge. And that is before we discuss the proposals for military production the Russian Republic has brought forward."

We might not be able to improve their material conditions, but we can at least guarantee the plentitude of cheap, shiny trinkets for them to buy their children as they work soul-crushingly long hours!\n\nFrom sundresses to hula hoops, the American material excess will be transplanted here root and branch to take root in Japanese soil - and as the toys grow ever shinier and larger, our children will thank us for it. The new commercial plastics, developed in America, will aid in producing all manner of domestic goods for households as well - one could call Japan's new infatuation a Plastic Love."

Our consumer firms shall bring a myriad of diverse tools and gadgets into every aspect of home life. Vacuums, radios, stereo players, even hair-dryers: the future electric is here to stay!\n\nThe sociologists tell us that the declining size of nuclear families has driven up demand for instant entertainment as well, due to less hands at home to manage housework and less leisure time as a result - further incentives to the televised entertainment industry and radio shows will ensure that Japanese media stays engrossing for the new Japanese household, both young and old.

Now that our economy is on a stable footing, however, they have grown stronger and their purchasing power higher than ever: if there was ever a time to meet their demands for modern products, it is now.\n\nWe will begin to open our domestic markets to local electronic goods, centred around the Sanshu No Jingi, the Three Sacred Artifacts - the television, the washing machine and the fridge. These three goods might be luxury - even unattainable to our lower class - but they are indelibly associated with modern life, and the Gods themselves cannot stand between the Tokyo worker and his love of the finer things."

Our workers throng the restaurants, the shopping malls and the tourism agencies: their private lives are now characterised not by the struggle to survive, but the struggle to outdo their neighbours in consumption and spending.\n\nThe Plastic Love, as it is known, has begun to overtake the country, and with their wallets comes political stability. We will make every effort to encourage their spending: elevated welfare programmes, corporate financial aid and generous tax cuts on the middle class will give every household access to the Bright Life. Soon the American Dream will fly off the screens and make its home in Japan itself!"

Our university research scene, in fact, has taken the post-war environment in stride, having adapted to Americanized degree types like the Master's and Bachelor's Degrees.\n\nWe will exploit this flexibility further, providing incentives for meritorious scholars to study to attain full degrees in America before returning as leaders in industry and government. In perhaps a decade or two we will have a scholarship base that has caught up with the West and can innovate on its own. The Meiji Restoration regime would be proud."

Many of our best talents have escaped overseas, and it will take a considerable effort to draw them back. But if there is one thing the Japanese are good at, it is public displays of affection!\n\nThe collaborative research projects, launched by our friends in the Zaibatsus, will be that display - with the most competitive salaries in Asia, access to American production technology and groundbreaking new areas of research opening up, it is the most attractive proposition open to our nation's research institutions. Japanese science, with a little guidance from the firms, will once again be the best in the world."

Our economic policies have been an unqualified success! The Government, however, has never been one to take good things for granted, and is considering enacting even bolder measures to boost corporate confidence.\n\nWe will loosen up on real-estate taxes, introduce bold new public welfare expenditures that will bring the bridges of Tokyo to every small town in the country, and pump investment into our international franchises. An ambitious young economist is even talking about doubling consumer income by the end of the decade. Our nation stands flush with cash, an economic giant of Asia: the future is and forever will be Made In Japan!"

For a nation struggling to feed and warm itself, Hokkaido is a godsend, and we have every intention of exploiting its riches to benefit the nation. Lack of Zaibatsu assets in the region also ensures that we can use this province as a blank slate for our planned economic policies - of which there are many.\n\nThe Hokkaido Development Bureau, established in 1950, will be the conduit of our Comprehensive Development Plan. Massive public works projects have already been planned out to develop the island's infrastructure, in preparation for the transition of Hokkaido into a fully integrated economic zone that will power the growth of the rest of Japan."

In a decade or so, we expect that Sapporo will become the jewel on the island's crown - until that day comes, we shall not rest."

Yet our agriculture remains primitive, non-mechanized and for the most part as inefficient as it was when the Shogun was overthrown.\n\nIf we do not remedy this, growth will slow even if Izanagi throws another Hokkaido into the sea tomorrow. We must introduce new tilling and crop-rotation methods to our primary crops, develop concentration methods for our livestock farms and fisheries, and identify land-plots where we can regenerate forest growth to enrich the soil. And when we have mastered the land and sea, we shall truly begin to harness the real wealth of this island."

Following the new techniques our American benefactors have imported from their homeland's major cities, we shall begin to modernize the shipping and importing systems that bring meat and grain to the mainland - the introduction of the shipping crate and the sterilization process will also make these imports far safer for domestic consumption.\n\nWith these methods in hand, convenience shopping and food importing will truly become something that can be done in a matter of an hour or less - the \"super-markets\" that stock these food supplies will spread across whole city blocks and feed entire districts. The future is bright for farming in Hokkaido, and for Japan's middle class."

Hokkaido Bureau-style development boards will allow for these conglomerates to work together and produce corporate quotas and joint investments, and even sponsor public works where the Government's budget is stretched thin.

The Hokkaido Model will take a more public-sector approach to finish rebuilding the dockyards, pumping funds into development banks, expanding the repaired road networks and developing plans for land-bridges to connect the three islands to further boost connectivity."

 twrjapan.1945111.d:0 "After years of occupation, the desire for Japanese freedom has finally been heard.\n\nAfter the administration's efforts in appeasing the Americans, combined with the growing fear of Chinese Expansionism in the Pacific, the United States of America has allowed the negotiation of restoring full Japanese sovereignty. These long negotiations ended in the hall of Ali'iolani Hale, where American and Japanese delgates officially signed the Treaty of Honolulu, ending the occupation and officially recognizing Japan as an independent nation, returning Japanese sovereignty to the control of the Japanese government. However, the treaty also allowed the Americans to maintain their military bases and occupation of specific islands, which is upsetting news for the opposition."
 twrjapan.1945111.a:0 "A new nation enters the stage!"

 twrjapan.1.t:0 "The Fallen Sun"
 twrjapan.1.d:0 "Japan is a defeated nation still recovering from long years of fighting in China, the Pacific and against the US. Its former colonies in Formosa, Korea, Sakhalin and the many islands dotting the Pacific were all but lost and torn from her grip. \n\nThe US defeated Japan thoroughly at sea, with many fateful battles taking its toll on the IJN. But Japan fought onm despite the fact that the allies landed on the southern island of Kyushu. With all of the Empire's population summoned as a desperate defense against the Allies, Japan's situation was dire at the end of the war. Japan was prepared to fight till their last drop of blood to defend the home islands, but then the Americans dropped an atomic bomb, followed by three more. Combined with a lasting blockade from the islands of Okinawa and up to the Kurils, any hopes of securing a conditional peace vanished.\n\nJapan would eventually unconditionally surrender to the US aboard the USS Iowa, signing a peace that greatly humiliated Japan. In the end, the US stood victorious over Japan, and has been the occupying Japan for over seven years. The Military Governor would lead the occupation forces in Japan, holding a role that was given extensive powers over American policy in the area. Mainly, their focus would lie on stabilizing the humbled nation with food-aid, medicinal aid and law reforms. Assistance in rebuilding the many major urban centres such as Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima and Nagoya would also be a central piece to the rebuilding and restructuring of Japan. As of 1952, this progress has advanced slowly but steadily, but resentment is brewing in the fledgling nation…"

 twrjapan.2.t:0 "Acknowledging the American Authorities"
 twrjapan.2.d:0 "Under the American boot, the Japanese Government had to take actions in getting a shot for nationhood, by reaching out to America and ignoring past conflicts and pardoning any crime committed by U.S Soldiers on Japanese soils. This might displease our citizens but it's an important step to pave the way for a Free Japan."
 twrjapan.2.a:0 "We had to do this."

 twrjapan.6.d:0 "Pressured by the Toronto Accord and China, Japan was forced to accept the results of the Far East Tribunal, taking full responsibility for the crimes and accepting Japanese guilt. And as a gesture to convince China to allow more autonomy to Japan, Japanese Government striked a deal to shut down the Imperial Shrine of Yasukuni, also promising to pay for the losses of Chinese lives during the Sino-Japanese Wars."

 twrjapan.8.d:0 "The Mayday of 1952 started with a general strike. Students and workers marched on the streets of Tokyo and other major cities, demanding the withdrawal of foreign influence from Japan, and declaring that Japanese Government is a puppet of the West. Riot Police were sent to control the crowds, but the conflict between protesters and officers turned violent after reports of gunshots in the Downtown Tokyo. Bands of Militias were formed by fanatical students and protesters, using weapons that were raided from police stations, the Riot Police are currently overwhelmed. Toronto Accord Garrisons in the area have been ordered to stay in their bases, and the Japanese Government is officially in a state of emergency."

 twrjapan.9.t:0 "Unification of the Social Democratic Party"
 twrjapan.9.d:0 "After the Mayday Bloodbath, politicians of the mainstream Left, namely Jōtarō Kawakami and Mosaburō Suzuki alongside their Rightist Socialist and Leftist Socialist Parties, which were results of political disagreements over the old Social Democratic Party, have came to a historic agreement to merge the parties once again, reusing the old banner of the Social Democratic Party. \n\nThis move has been viewed by political analyzers as one of the wiser moves that the Japanese Leftists have thought of, in response to the Mayday Bloodbath and a move to show solidarity within the Left. Unoffical polls conducted by the Tokyo University concludes that the Social Democratic Party has gained new support from the angered intellectuals and Middle Class."
 twrjapan.9.a:0 "A United Social Democratic Party!"

 twrjapan.10.t:0 "The Law of Stability"
 twrjapan.10.d:0 "A group of conservative politicians and legislative members of the Japanese Government, co-sponsored by the Ministry of Justice, has proposed a law to allow police intervention during times of crisis in Japan, listing possible crises such as 'Unprovoked Rebellions', 'Foreign Invasion', 'Unlawful Coup Attempt', 'Rapid Deterioration of Stability' and 'Conspiracy Against the Constitution'. This bill would greatly increase the National Police's influence, but serve as a great deterrence and vanguard of Japanese values. After the trauma of Mayday, support for the bill is certainly present within the Government."
 twrjapan.10.a:0 "The proposal passed!"

However, the National Police and the Occupation Authority concludes that no such group exists, it's presumed this is an attack concluded and planned by one single person.\n\nWe have received an official apology from the Japanese Government, but some critics are questioning the progress of re-education in Occupied Japan."

 twrjapan.13.d:0 "Shortly after the Yokohama Attack, small crowds of protesters held small demonstrations around the Hokkaido region, voicing their support for the kamikaze pilot, calling him a 'National Hero' and a 'Wakeup call for Japan'. Anxious about a Occupation Authority response, the demonstrations were quickly shut down, as officers were ordered to scatter the crowd to prevent an escalation. The demonstrations ended peacefully, but it's a major alarm for the Japanese Government, signalling nationalistic elements remain stubborn amongst the Japanese population."
 twrjapan.13.a:0 "Don't spook the Yanks!"

 twrjapan.14.t:0 "Discovery of Widespread Corruption"
 twrjapan.14.d:0 "After a sizable quantity of funds from the MacArthur Plan vanished from the Government, an investigation was launched, and after days of networking and brief investigations, it was discovered that millions were pocketed by local officials and criminal syndicates. It is currently unknown how the criminals gained access to the funds, and the list of associated politicians are still merely speculations."
 twrjapan.14.a:0 "Holy shit..."

 twrjapan.15.t:0 "Resumed Elections"
 twrjapan.15.d:0 "After the dust has settled in Japan, the Japanese elections have been resumed. Politicians are now launching their campaigns in securing support from the people. In the upcoming elections however, the newly united Social Democratic Party would benefit the most from the shellshock after Mayday Bloodbath.\n\nOn the other hand, the ruling Jiyutō would face a rougher democratic enviroment due to the massive political turmoil that occured under their rule. Meanwhile the liberal Kaishintō brands Jiyutō and the Social Democrats as both nationalists and leftsts which caused hundreds of deaths during the Mayday Bloodbath, calling themselves the most logical, and moderate solution to Japan."
 twrjapan.15.a:0 "Let the flowers bloom!"

 twrjapan.16.t:0 "Rumours of Election Fraud"
 twrjapan.16.d:0 "Informed by special departments of the National Police, reports claim a possible Social Democrat-Marxist coalition might form if the Social Democrats ever win the election. While this might be viewed as normal election techniques, an additional detail stated the Social Democratic Party might be committing election frauds on a prefecture level.\n\nWhile the cabinet is shocked, these reports lack reliable citations or evidence."
 twrjapan.16.a:0 "Execute the Law of Stability."
 twrjapan.16.b:0 "This was clearly a lie."

 twrjapan.17.t:0 "Election Results"
 twrjapan.17.d:0 "After hours of counting the ballots, the results of the general election have finally been published. Being the first election after the brutal Mayday of 1952, the outcome of this election would be crucial to Japan's future policies. \n\nWhile a number of minor complaints were filed in voting locations, the election went smoothly, but one question remains in everyone's mind - Did the Social Democrats' merger and the Bloody Mayday made any major impact on this year's election?"
 twrjapan.17.a:0 "One more term for the Jiyuto!"
 twrjapan.17.b:0 "The Kaishinto won!"
 twrjapan.17.c:0 "The Social Democrats won!"

 twrjapan.18.t:0 "Execution of the Stability Law"
 twrjapan.18.d:0 "With Japanese democracy tested, the Stability Law has been declared in effect by the Government. Multiple divisions of the National Police supported by specialised teams secured key locations within all majors cities of Japan. The invited coup was conducted in an orderly manner, and after hours, the entirety of Tokyo was under National Police's control, with normal civillian actions resumed as normal to indicate normality. The Tokyo Imperial Palace and National Diet Building are now heavily guarded by armed officers. \n\nA government radio address and press statement surfaced, and formally, the Government is now under National Police command, and the Crisis Government will be the body of government until further notice."
 twrjapan.18.a:0 "It was necessary."

 twrjapan.19.t:0 "Japan Divided"
 twrjapan.19.d:0 "After a brutal war against another radical Japanese regime, Japanese mainland has fallen once again after a coalition intervention to protect Japanese Democracy. Members of the coalition, including major members of the Toronto Accord and the Republic of China met in Kyoto, and the bases for a stable, fair Japanese occupation has been agreed upon, dividing Japan into multiple control zones headed by their overlord countries.\n\nIn just decades, Japan went from united, broken, recovery into a broken nation once again."
 twrjapan.19.a:0 "Set up the zones!"

 twrjapan.20.t:0 "The Kyoto Agreement"
 twrjapan.20.d:0 "After a failed attempt of radicalism in Japan, the coalition between Chinese and Toronto Accord forces managed to occupy Japan once again since the end of the Pacific War. This coalition fought under the United Nations banner despite none of these actions were planned or discussed within the UN, making this an act of aggression on an international level. The fact is, Japan is now occupied, and delegates from different members within the Coalition have met in Kyoto, and signed the join Kyoto Agreement, dividing Japan into different zones of control under new leadership. Tokyo is now declared a "Special International Zone", where troops from third-party nations bearing the UN banner are stationed instead of TA or Chinese garrisons.\n\nCurrently, the authorities are busy disarming any remaining threats, while ridding the Japanese government of any members who showed support for the previous regime."
 twrjapan.20.a:0 "They never learnt..."

 twrjapan.21.t:0 "Rise of the Japanese Confederation"
 twrjapan.21.d:0 "A product of the Kyoto Agreement, after months of stabilizing, the formation of the North Honshu Federaton signal a new dawn for Japanese nationalism. The terms of the Kyoto Agreement suggest that, each controlled zones should be reorganized and given independence under a new loosely administrated body - The Japanese Confederation. The Japanese Confederation is designed to be a union of independent administrations instead of a unified nations, intended to destroy Japan's capability to truly recover and ensure foreign hegmony over Japan and the Pacific, while maintaining cooperation between each Japanese states. The Imperial Family's role has been reduced to "National Figure", but were allowed to reside within the Royal Palace and maintain a company of Imperial Guards, funded by the Confederation Parliament.\n\nWith North Honshu being the first, soon other occupiers will follow America's footsteps, and allow these regions to declare their independence under the greater body, of the Japanese Confederation."
 twrjapan.21.a:0 "Confederation, more like Prison Japan!"

 twrjapan.23.t:0 "Building a Nation"
 twrjapan.23.d:0 "Japan has finally regained it's independence from the Americans. While most of the political system has been designed by the Occupation Command, there have been some oversights within the details.\n\nFor example, the Occupation Command was too fixated on disarming the nation and wiping the slate of Jingoism clean and left us with vague terms on the Imperial that can be used to restructure the structure slightly. A brief discussion with the British embassy suggested the possibility of a treaty loophole that might allow a minor revision, that might be able to turn the Monarch from being a 'prop', to an official figurehead status."
 twrjapan.23.a:0 "The State of Japan rises!"

 twrjapan.24.t:0 "The Hirohito Question"
 twrjapan.24.d:0 "Being the figurehead during Japan's invasion of Asia, Emperor Hirohito has become a controversial figurehead in the international community. Despite that, major foreign influencers have secretly agreed on Japan's plan to utilize the constitutional loophole to provide legal status for the Imperials, with one condition - Hirohito must abdicate and allow Takahito, Hirohito's younger brother to usurp the title of Japanese Head Of State as the Regent. While this might be seen as unfavourable, Takahito promises that the throne will return to Hirohito's line of succession upon Takahito's demise.\n\nHowever, if Hirohito refuses this offer of abdication, he will simply stay as the powerless, nameless figurehead of Japan, with the status quo forever affirmed until a majority of politicians and population agreeing to alter the system."
 twrjapan.24.a:0 "Hirohito will stay."
 twrjapan.24.b:0 "Take the deal, for the greater good..."

 twrjapan.25.t:0 "Takahito's Accesion"
 twrjapan.25.d:0 "With secret dealings, Hirohito has abdicated, naming Takahito his Regent in a low profile ceremony. Takahito was sworn in as Japan's new head of state in a relatively quick phase, but most importantly, alongside Takahito's accesion to the throne, Japan was also reclassified as an official Constitutional Monarchy, with the Monarch holding no power but an official title within the national code.\n\nTakahito's interesting upbringing and character will surely bring a breath of fresh air into the Imperial Family, with Japan's outward friendly side being more apparent to the international community at large."
 twrjapan.25.a:0 "Banzai!"

 twrjapan.26.t:0 "Liberal Democratic Party Formed"
 twrjapan.26.d:0 "With the Social Democrats becoming a dangerous threat, the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party led by Ichirō Hatoyama have agreed to merge into a catch-all party, capturing all elements of the Center-Right with different ideological beliefs.\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party's party goal aims to flush Japan into an age of political stability, which might encourage economic development with consistent economic policies due to the one major party situation."
 twrjapan.26.a:0 "Unity!"

 twrjapan.27.t:0 "Facing Our Criminal Past"
 twrjapan.27.d:0 "In the past decades, Japan has committed many crimes on the people of Asia, as a result, relations between the Post-War Japan and her East Asian neighbours remained low due to Japan's stubbornness in refusing to acknowledge past mistakes. But, under a new regime with a changed attitude, we should gather the courage and face our criminal past, so that we can move onward for a brighter future."
 twrjapan.27.a:0 "Apologize to China."
 twrjapan.27.b:0 "Apologize to Korea."
 twrjapan.27.c:0 "Apologize to both China and Korea."
 
 twrjapan.28.t:0 "Japan Offers an Apology"
 twrjapan.28.d:0 "Unexpectedly, the Prime Minister of Japan has personally issued an apology to our nation's people, apologizing for Japan's harsh crimes committed during the war and throughout history. Begging the people to forgive Japan and grant her a second chance, so that the two nations can work together for a brighter future."
 twrjapan.28.a:0 "Accept their apology."
 twrjapan.28.b:0 "An apology is not enough, demand concessions."
 
 twrjapan.29.t:0 "Relations Restored with [FROM.GetName]"
 twrjapan.29.d:0 "Relieved by our gestures, our apology was well received. The [FROM.GetAdjective] Government has accepted Japan's apology and agreed to forgive Japan for her previous crimes. Opening the potential for Asian cooperation once more."
 twrjapan.29.a:0 "Let bygones be bygones."
 
 twrjapan.30.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Additional Concessions"
 twrjapan.30.d:0 "Unsatisfied by the lackluster apology, The [FROM.GetAdjective] has demanded additional concessions on top of the apology. While this might be the only way to improve relations, politicians within Japan are already angered by the government's attempts at appeasing these foreigners rather than focusing on pleasing its population."
 twrjapan.30.a:0 "Agree to their demands."
 twrjapan.30.b:0 "This was a mistake from the start."
 
 twrjapan.31.t:0 "Japan Agrees"
 twrjapan.31.d:0 "Shockingly, the Japanese have agreed to hand us additional concessions on top of their apology, giving us a favourable deal that is more than enough for our administration to put their past behaviours behind them. With the victims of war appeased and the economic damages covered by the concessions, our administration has deemed Japan's gesture to be adequate for forgiveness."
 twrjapan.31.a:0 "Great!"
 
 twrjapan.32.t:0 "Japan Refuses"
 twrjapan.32.d:0 "Refusing to give us additional concessions, the stubborn Japanese have showed their true colours once again. Their crocodile tears have been revealed after the suggestion of economic concessions were raised, showing that the Japanese have no true intentions to act up for their criminal past."
 twrjapan.32.a:0 "As expected from the scum."
 
 twrjapan.33.t:0 "Snap Elections Called"
 twrjapan.33.d:0 "In true democratic fashion, Prime Minister Kishi has called a snap election, in a bid to secure himself another term. This snap election was unexpected by many, leaving most of the opposition unable to launch their adequate campaigns. The Liberal Democratic Party has promised a free and fair election with absolutely no corruption invloved, repeatedly stating that Japanese Democracy has proven to be the best example of Democracy in the whole of Asia.\n\nWith a quick election, alongside a quick ballot counting process, the final victor of the election is announced..."
 twrjapan.33.a:0 "Kishi wins the elections!"
 twrjapan.33.b:0 "Kishi wins the elections! Shocking!"
 
 twrjapan.34.t:0 "Japan Denounces Us"
 twrjapan.34.d:0 "Expected from an Imperialist puppet, the Japanese have denounced China in an effort to discredit her from the international community at large. In the Japanese Prime Minister's speech, he spoke of nonsense such as the phrase 'Chinese Expansionism', and how America and Japan are 'the safeguards of democracy in Asia'. Our foreign department has chose to ignore this comment entirely, with patriotic locals organizing civilian protests in front of the Japanese embassy in Nanjing."
 twrjapan.34.a:0 "Ignore those Japanese bastards."
 
 twrjapan.35.t:0 "Status of the Merger"
 twrjapan.35.d:0 "After the Mayday tragedy, the two branches of Social Democratic Party put aside their differences to reunite into a single, strong political party for the moderate left. However, this victory also calls for a single leader that is able to maintain this coalition. The Rightists and Leftists shall now decide which branch's leader is most suitable to lead Japan as her newly elected Prime Minister."
 twrjapan.35.a:0 "The Rightists secure a majority!"
 twrjapan.35.b:0 "The Leftists secure a majority!"

 twrjapan.66.t:0 "The Liberal Democratic Party"
 twrjapan.66.d:0 "A conservative party formed by a merger of different bodies of right-wing parties, the Liberal Democratic Party is destined to become the dominant conservative camp in Japanese politics. With it's sole opposition being the Social Democrats, the Liberal Democratic Party will surely alter the Japanese political system for years to come.\n\nWhile the party's name is officially the Liberal Democratic Party, the political party does not endorse Western Liberal politics."
 twrjapan.66.a:0 "Alright."

 twrjapan.65.t:0 "Takahito Usurps the Throne"
 twrjapan.65.d:0 "The emperor of Japan, Hirohito, has renounced his claim on the Imperial throne in an unprecedented move - as the 'transitional period' ends, his chosen Prime Regent, Takahito, has taken his place as the head of state in an official Constitutional Monarchy. Takahito's youthful looks and intellect have charmed worldwide audiences, with foreign dignitaries reporting (in an infamous telegram) that the new Emperor is 'something of a looker'. \n\nTakahito's notable pacifist views on global affairs and criticism of the dark history of Japan's conduct in Asia, however, have met a very different domestic reception. Senior politicians in the Diet declined to echo the Emperor's views on Imperial Nationalism, saying only that the Emperor was 'a symbol of the national spirit, not a mouthpiece'."
 twrjapan.65.a:0 "Refreshing."
 twrjapan.65.b:0 "Banzai...?"

 twrjapan.64.t:0 "The Japanese Police Coup"
 twrjapan.64.d:0 "Due to internal political instability and potential threats to the democratic values of Japan, the Law of Stability was passed to give the National Police rights to execute it with the Government's invitation. And hours ago, reports from Japan confirmed that the Government has declared emergency and formally enacted the Law of Stability, inviting the National Police to form a transitional government to handle Japan in times of crisis. The invited coup was reportedly orderly executed, with little to no casualties.\n\nThe U.S Garrisons reported no movements and incidents during the coup, signalling no intervention would take place."
 twrjapan.64.a:0 "It's just a transition."

 twrjapan.67.t:0 "Kishi Secures LDP Leadership"
 twrjapan.67.d:0 "After a brief power struggle within the newly merged Liberal Democratic Party, Nobusuke Kishi has managed to best all of his internal competitions and became the party boss. With his influence within the LDP secured, Kishi is also nominated by his majority party to become the Prime Minister of Japan, taking up the responsibility of forming a new Japanese cabinet.\n\nWith Kishi being such a controversial figure with his history during the Pacific War, it is certain that his time as Prime Minister will be one filled with great controversy and internal struggles instigated by the Japanese Left. Regardless, it is unclear on rather his time as LDP party boss and Prime Minister would be long but, only time will tell."
 twrjapan.67.a:0 "From a convict to a leader."

 twrjapan.68.t:0 "Kishi Wins in Snap Election"
 twrjapan.68.d:0 "Due to political pressure from his own cabinet, Prime Minister Kishi has called a snap election to regain his political leverage on the nation and the Liberal Democratic Party. In this test of Kishi's popularity, the LDP successfully achieved a landslide victory.\n\nWhile Kishi's leadership is now firmly unquestioned, rumours of electoral fraud have circulated, with claims of the LDP deploying 'intimidator thugs' around voting stations to ensure support, also partnering with crime syndicates to threaten any local opponents by harassing them or their family in an attempt to destroy any cohensive opposition to the ruling party.\n\nBoth the government has denied any claims of electoral fraud."
 twrjapan.68.a:0 "Something is afoot here..."

 twrjapan.69.t:0 "A Liberal Democratic Dictatorship"
 twrjapan.69.d:0 "Since the snap election, Prime Minister Kishi has managed to destroy all of his political enemies. Now with the National Diet solely staffed by legislators loyal to the LDP, Kishi has made a daring attempt to amend the constitution while bypassing the process' required referendum, cementing the Liberal Democratic Party as Japan's sole legal ruling party.\n\nWhat Kishi has done is an utter violation of democratic values laid by the occupation, but Kishi's proven loyalty was enough for them to turn a blind eye, some even suggesting that the Americans secretly approves of what Kishi and the LDP is doing, placing stability above democratic virtures.\n\nThe State of Japan is now officially a hybrid 'One Party Democracy'."
 twrjapan.69.a:0 "Neither Liberal, nor Democratic."

 twrjapan.70.t:0 "Nobusuke Kishi Assassinated"
 twrjapan.70.d:0 "With increasing oppression performed by the Kishi regime, this state of affairs has angered many in the country.\n\nPrime Minister Kishi attended an event for a gentlemen's club, gathering political support from the social elites of Tokyo, and just when Kishi was holding a speech, a waitress managed to ambush Kishi with her dagger. Immediately, the waitress was apprehended, later proven to be Michiko Kanba in disguise.\n\nAfter the stabbing, Kishi was still conscious and was hurried to the nearest medical facility. However, the stab was fatal, and any emergency attempts were futile, resulting in hours of agony before the Prime Minister's ultimate demise."
 twrjapan.70.a:0 "An untimely death."

 twrjapan.72.t:0 "Request CIA Support"
 twrjapan.72.d:0 "As we prepare to enforce the power of our new government and crack down on dissidents, it would help immensely to have the active support of American intelligence services, such as the CIA. We already enjoy favourable relations with some in the US intelligence community, so we should ask them for more active support."
 twrjapan.72.a:0 "Send a request."

 twrjapan.73.t:0 "Japan Requests CIA Support"
 twrjapan.73.d:0 "Following the recent police coup, the new regime in Japan, seeking to reinforce its power, has approached us asking for intelligence support from the CIA to prop up their new government. Aside from the moral implications of supporting the crackdowns of an authoritarian government, some have worries for obvious historical reasons about supporting a nationalist government in Japan. At the same time, others see this as a chance to crush left wing radicals in Japan, and by supporting them we could have greater influence in the country and they are more likely to align towards us in future. How shall we respond?"
 twrjapan.73.a:0 "Give them CIA help"
 twrjapan.73.b:0 "Refuse."

 twrjapan.74.t:0 "USA Accepts"
 twrjapan.74.d:0 "The Americans have accepted, and will give us the support and funding from the CIA we requested."

 twrjapan.78.d:0 "Now that Japan has been liberated from fascistic imperial oppression, a total reformation of the monetary system is needed. While it'd be ideal to have a moneyless society, we can't always get everything we want. The yen will be reformed to be the currency of the people, rather than that of the landed bourgeois. If we wish to totally transform Japanese society, it stands to reason that we should print new money.\nThe metrics of the yen are functional for the most part and will remain unchanged, but its value has deteriorated sharply since the war. As such, our foremost goal will be to restore the yen's value while renovating it to have a more leftist character. To help our citizens understand that a rejuvenation of the Japanese economy is at hand, the appearance of the yen will be changed as well. The faces of famed Japanese leftists such as Kanno Sugako and Itō Noe will be featured on these new bills. By removing depictions of the emperor and imperial imagery, we'll demonstrate that we're casting off the old order in favor of a newer, fairer one."

 twrjapan.79.d:0 "When we have started our economic development plans by relying on excessive wealths that had been confiscated, everyone except students saw this coming.

 twrjapan.82.t:0 "Temple of the Golden Pavilion Published"
 twrjapan.82.d:0 "\"When people concentrate on the idea of beauty, they are, without realizing it, confronted with the darkest thoughts that exist in this world. That, I suppose, is how human beings are made.\"\n\nYukio Mishima, the youngest and now most famous writer in Japan, has published his latest work - and it is already a bestseller. Temple of the Golden Pavillion is a recounting of the events leading to the infamous burning of the eponymous Kinkaku-ji in Kyoto, tracing the narrator as he enters the temple as an acolyte and begins to slide into psychological depravity. A long list of characters follows him on his journeys into adolescence: the brutal Kashiwagi, the enigmatic Father Dozen, and the haunting and sinister figure of the Temple itself, both oppressor and environment.\n\nMishima's work is being hailed as the best signature work of his trademark style of psychological examination, and many look forward to seeing what he does next - Mishima began writing in 1944, and his 12 years of effort have created masterpieces like Confessions of a Mask, a masterpiece of the coming-of-age genre. This is not to say that he is without controversy, however: Debate arises anew over Mishima's tangled examination of masculinity, sexual attraction, obsession and sadism, and some have even gone so far as to suggest that the ugly, alienated narrator of Temple is linked to the homoeroticism displayed in Confessions.\n\nThese voices, of course, are hushed up in front of the international audience - it would not do to have Japan's literary enfant terrible shamed in the public eye. Temple of the Golden Pavillion is sold overseas in a package with The Sound of Waves, a far more reassuring, simple and cisgender-appealing romance. It is believed that this will calm moral guardians in the West as to Mishima's true nature, and perhaps leaven the shocking emotions he nakedly displays in his art."

While the Japanese people are now desperate to defend their islands, the scenes of Operation Downfall just years ago will soon repeat themselves, turning the Home Islands into a battlefield once again."

 twrjapan.84.t:0 "Japanese Imperial Restoration"
 twrjapan.84.d:0 "Following the police coup, the Japanese Government has announced the restoration of the Japanese throne's legal status, restoring the Imperial authority over Japan.\n\nWhile this restoration does not mean a course for aggressive expansion, the restoration of imperial authority symbolizes the return of a traditionalist Japan, fuelled by the Japanese people's hatred towards the occupation.\n\nThe Japanese Government has promised to not embark on another path of war, but few are confident about the future of Japan."

 twrjapan.85.d:0 "Memories of the empire have been invoked in Tokyo, as a union of Japanese Ultranationalists have succeeded in taking power. Angered by the perceived ineffectiveness of the democratic government, and its ties to the United States, the nationalists have declared that they will bring an age of "national rejuvenation" to Japan and the Japanese people. Already, leftist and liberal elements across the country are being suppressed, as the nationalist begin to cement their rule. Whether or not this period of Japanese history will last long, or have a significant effect, is yet to be seen."

 twrjapan.86.d:0 "It was clear to all that instability and chaos had been rocking Japanese politics recently, but few could have predicted the most recent political direction the country has taken. Building on the wave of a sudden surge in public support, Japan’s anarchist groups have managed to maneuver themselves into a position of power. And yet, it is power structures and hierarchical government that are the things they oppose. It remains to be seen to what extent such a radical group will attempt or succeed such an extensive and experimental program of social restructuring as the one they have been calling for."

Ryukyu has been under foreign control since 1879, which means their recent declaration marks a historic end of the long period of foreign rule.\n\nHowever, the State of Ryukyu is still required to allow their former overlord's military to operate on their soil, leading some to think of this nation as an \"informal puppet\"."

All that they deem bourgeois or counterrevolutionary must be removed from the new Japan, and that includes the Chrysanthemum Throne.\nSet before a firing squad, the Emperor was allowed to have a final meal and word by the revolutionary people's tribunal which sentenced him to death. As he was set against a brick-wall, he declared that the Throne has the backing of God behind it, and that no temporal force can slay it. He then suffered several gunshots to his head and chest.\n\nThe Japanese government has made no comment about what will be done with his body."

 ###Leader Desc
 
 POLITICS_ASANUMA_INEJIRO_DESC:0 "Of all the figures in Japan's left, none quite compare to the bombastic head of the Nippon Socialists known as Inajiro Asanuma. Born into a poor family of peasants in Miyake-jima, Asanuma enrolled in a private university to study economics. Involving himself in socialist student circles, he stood out among his colleagues as a loud and fiery orator, he had been nicknamed the "Human Locomotive". During his work as a left wing activist, he became deeply concerned with the rights of trade unions being trampled on as the Taisho era made way for gradual authoritarianism. Elected to the Imperial Diet in 1936 as a social democratic candidate, he began drifting further to the left as the military began pushing all suspected opposition parties to the side as they brought Japan further into a war it was unable to win. Resigning from politics once war broke out with the west, he returned to a post-war Japan with a new mandate inspired by his comrades in China. This controversial manifesto known as the "Three Banners" advocates for sweeping cultural and social revival under the teachings of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist thought. Now in charge of Japan following a popular wave of leftist unrest, Japan looks to Chairman Inajiro with the hope of a new Japanese nation under the red banner of socialism."
 POLITICS_MIYAMOTO_KENJI_DESC:0 "Kenji Miyamoto is an unassuming person on the surface, a prolific writer who joined the Japanese Communist Party in 1931 while it was still an illegal underground movement. During this period of illegal political activities, he advocated for a violent communist revolution in Japan. Being arrested and sentenced to life in prison in a very sketchy murder case, Miyamoto was eventually released with the rest of the Communist Party when the American occupation began. Known for his talented debating skills and connections in socialist student movements, Miyamoto is an extremely powerful politician underneath his typically meek appearance. Now in control of the communist Japan that he had dreamed of for decades, his attention now turns to guiding the nation through the transition towards socialism. And eventually, its debut in spreading his Marxist ideas throughout East Asia."
