twriceland.1.t:0 "1953 Icelandic Parliamentary Election"
twriceland.1.d:0 "The 1953 Parliamentary Election is contested by three major parties of Iceland, with the Independence Party and Progressive Party being the most likely winners. However, the recently formed "People's Alliance", a coalition formed by the Socialists and Social Democrats, which advocates for Iceland's total neutrality from world affairs, alongside an attractive policy of preserving Iceland's fishing rights with no quarters given to the Accord has been gaining attention from the public, and can surely be considered one of the major players in this election."
twriceland.1.a:0 "The Independence Party wins the election!"
twriceland.1.b:0 "Progressives wins in a slight lead!"
twriceland.1.c:0 "Leftist coalition secured an unexpected victory!"
twriceland.2.t:0 "Death of Sveinn Björnsson"
twriceland.2.d:0 "Our nation never asked for the circumstances that drove Sveinn Björnsson into his executive office, but it could not have received a better leader to have greatness thrust upon him. As fair a legislator as he was a Regent, Björnsson will be remembered as a loyal trustee of Iceland and a hallmark of reluctant, but capable, leadership in trying times.\n\nBjörnsson was born in Denmark, taking on the trappings of a legal career there and serving in the Upper Courts before moving to Reykjavik to serve in civic councils. By all accounts he had expected to settle into a stable legal career in middle-age, but the German invasion interrupted this peace as the Danish Government was overwhelmed by German arms, leaving Iceland an unmoored boat on a chill and stormy sea. English and American assistance made Iceland 'independent' almost immediately afterwards; considering circumstances on the Continent, they were welcomed.\n\nBjörnsson was elected Regent of Iceland, taking over the duties of King Christian, and with a steady hand he guided the formation of an unstable but lively democracy, threatening to rule by executive authority during the 1949 crisis, and standing against the Germans with the Danish Government-In-Exile despite his personal distaste for the Danish king. Despite occasional accusations of tyranny Sveinn was greatly respected by his people in life, and in death Iceland mourns the loss of an eminent and dutiful President. We will serve the country he shepherded into being, and its survival will be a monument to his works."
twriceland.2.a:0 "Farwell, Mister President..."
twriceland.3.t:0 "1952 Presidental Election"
twriceland.3.d:0 "After the death of the First President, an emergency election is held. With few contenders, Ásgeir Ásgeirsson won the election and was sworn in as the second president of the Republic of Iceland."
twriceland.3.a:0 "Welcome, mister president."
twriceland.4.t:0 "Socialists Fulfill Promises"
twriceland.4.d:0 "As part of the Socialists' agenda, Iceland will be leaving the Toronto Accord, in order to secure greater independence from the American imperialists. While the Parliament is torn on this issue, the Socialists are going to use their popular will to enforce their demands in getting Iceland out of the Toronto Accord.\n\nWe have issued our demands to the U.S, requesting the closure of all military bases in Iceland."
twriceland.4.a:0 "Þetta reddast!"
twriceland.5.t:0 "Iceland Leaves the Toronto Accord"
twriceland.5.d:0 "Since the last Icelandic election, the Leftist Government of Iceland has been increasingly Anti-West, advocating for Total Neutrality. While political experts in the West suggested that Iceland leaving the Toronto Accord is simply impossible and that the Leftists are only using the slogan as means to gain popular votes, Iceland's idealistic government has proved them wrong. Iceland has officially declared her departure from the Toronto Accord, and demanded the U.S to close their bases on Icelandic soils."
twriceland.5.a:0 "Oh."
twriceland.5.b:0 "Iceland Forever!"
twriceland.6.t:0 "Securing the North Sea Passage"
twriceland.6.d:0 "To the U.S General Staff, Iceland's departure from Toronto Accord simply cannot be allowed to happen. Iceland's strategic importance as the base of operation between the North Sea and the Americas is simply too valuable, and it is unacceptable for the country to leave the Toronto Accord or for us to close our bases in Iceland. Our Marines and the Coast Guards are ready to intervene at a minute's notice."
twriceland.6.a:0 "Bring them down."
twriceland.6.b:0 "Live and let live."
twriceland.7.t:0 "U.S Occupation"
twriceland.7.d:0 "Our demands of U.S pulling out of Iceland have been ignored. Instead of allowing Iceland to leave the Toronto Accord, the U.S Garrisons in Reykjavík and other bases dotted around Iceland have made their moves. U.S Forces moved out of their bases, securing key locations and important roads. On the coast of Reykjavík, two American Coast Guard vessels were spotted, where they unloaded few dozens American marines into the city. [Root.GetLeader] has been arrested by the American forces, and the Leftist government has been disbanded, in favour of a coalition government between the elements of Social Democrats, Conservatives, and Liberals.\n\nIceland is now effectively under American occupation, but the Military Commander of Iceland has promised to not disturb Iceland's regular functions. The President of Iceland has maintained his post as President, and the officials on a local level have been unaffected by the American occupation."
twriceland.7.a:0 "Son of a..."
twriceland.8.t:0 "Iceland Occupied by U.S"
twriceland.8.d:0 "Due to Iceland's isolationist policies, the U.S Government has decided to overthrow the Socialist regime within Iceland. With both the Coast Guards and Marines cooperating, the transfer and overthrow of Iceland was swift, with little to no resistance. The former Icelandic socialist leader has been arrested by American authorities, and the atmosphere around Iceland's Capital Reykjavík is relatively calm besides the few cases of civil unrest.\n\nWhile the U.S Government might suffer from a drop in approval, they have expressed the necessity of Iceland in order to combat Nazi influence in the North Sea. Promises are made by the temporary Occupation Government, such as the restoration of Icelandic Democracy as soon as possible, and the authorities' respect towards local institutions. Besides members of the Far-Left Socialists, other members of the Parliament were not directly affected by the occupation, having the ability to resume their daily tasks."
twriceland.8.a:0 "This was expected."
twriceland.8.b:0 "Y'all behave now, ok?"
