Getulio_Vargas_desc:0 "As the architect of the nationalist Brazilian Estado Novo, Getúlio Vargas has become one of the most important figures in modern Brazilian history. Brought to power in 1930 by the armed forces, Vargas ended the old liberal republic and its coffee-and-milk politics and brought Brazil into an age of strongman populism. While his New State, founded in 1937, was inspired by the Italian government of Mussolini, Vargas was not a friend of the far-right, crushing the integralist movement in 1938, and improved ties with the United States through supplying the allied forces with Brazilian products and resources. With the end of the Second World War, the New State had changed its face as its ties with the United States created a paradox at home: an authoritarian regime ruled by a strongman with fascist sympathies joining forces with the liberal Allies made no sense to the Brazilian middle class. This, combined with growing resentment against Vargas' dictatorship, forced him into liberalizing most of the system, allowing the return of the opposition parties and thereby weakening the Estado Novo. Vargas would be forced to resign by his own war ministry, with democracy returning a few short months later to Brazil. \n\nThe end of Estado Novo, however, was not the end of Vargas' career. His successor, President Dutra, rapidly became even more hated than Vargas had ever been for his collaboration with what Brazil perceived as American economic colonialism. Vargas, ever the nationalist, exploited this to gain a landslide victory in the 1951 presidential election. Emergency nationalisation policies have begun to reduce the economic crisis brought by Dutra's policies, but his authoritarian sympathies continue to worry his opposition: Vargas won the Presidency by popular mandate, but he is unlikely to leave when he loses the latter."

Plinio_Salgado_desc:0 "Founder of the Brazilian integralist movement, Salgado has become a controversial figure in Brazilian politics. As a former supporter of the Vargas regime, Salgado quickly fell out of grace for promoting integralist uprisings against the government, leading to his exile to Portugal. Returning to Brazil in 1945 with the beginning of the democratic process, Salgado founded the Party of Popular Representation, recycling the old integralist doctrine with the ideas he had learned from the Spanish and Portuguese governments back in Europe. While the party is clearly a fascist party, Salgado praised Vargas' regime in its decision to declare war against the German Reich and Italy in the end stages of the Second World War. His continued ambitions to become the next Brazilian president has been noted by many in the nation, including the Americans that closely watch Brazil and its actions. The CIA continues to fear Salgado's potential rise to power, as a possible fascist power in South America could be a serious geopolitical risk for the United States."
Eduardo_Gomes_desc:0 "Eduardo Gomes may have graduated from the Realengo Military Academy in 1918, it was still rather clear that a career on land would never have fit this Brazilian military lad, as he quickly started his course at the Military Aviation School in Rio de Janeiro in 1921. From there, Gomes would jump on military revolutionary bandwagons as if it was a sport and would often face the consequences of his decisions. After several years of imprisonment, Gomes saw the streets of Brazil once more in 1930, just in time for the presidential election. Once more, Gomes involved himself with revolutionary elements in the Brazilian army and successfully prevented Júlio Prestes from taking office, placing Vargas on the hypothetical throne. Gomes would continue being a notable figure in the Vargas administration, leading the 1st Aviation Division against the communist revolution of 1937. His friendship with Vargas would be short, however, as he resigned following the establishment of the Estado Novo. Now being a fierce opponent of Vargas, Gomes tried to run in 1945 and 1950, but lost both times. Today, a bitter Gomes seemingly keeps his politics to himself as Air Marshal, but, just like all those other times, Gomes has continued to plot, as the military might of the Brazilian armed forces continue to back him against Vargas."
Juscelino_Kubitschek_desc:0 "As the son of a poor Czech family in Brazil and with his father dying 2 years after his birth, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira was not a boy of many hopes. While an average student, Kubitschek eventually graduated from the University of Minas Gerais as a medical doctor. After leaving the country for some years to work in Europe as a doctor, he would return after the 1930 revolution and the ascension of Vargas. Under Vargas, Kubitschek befriended the governor of Minas Gerais, who would name him the Chief of Staff in 1932. In 1934, Kubitschek would begin his long career in the federal chamber of deputies with the support of the Progressive Party. Later on, Kubitschek would become mayor of Belo Horizonte twice and, eventually, governor of Minas Gerais, during which he highlighted the importance of infrastructure and power plants. Kubitschek has become a popular figure among the Brazilian people, as a boy of few hopes became the Brazilian of many ambitions. His famous ‘Fifty years of Progress in Five' program has made him an extremely wanted choice among the people, as his vocal support for regional development and economic diversification has been music to people's ears."

Acute_Balance_of_Payments_Crisis_desc:0 "One can easily compare the Brazilian economy of the late ‘40s to the early ‘50s as a sinking boat: The Brazilian economy saw serious stagnation during the Dutra presidency due to growing inflation, an overvalued foreign-exchange rate and repressed demand. These ‘holes' in the economy have created a balance of payments crisis, destabilizing our economy in the process. While Dutra's regime was rather open to foreign businesses, Vargas has chosen a protectionist route of Brazilian exports. The idea of a multiple-exchange-rate system has received support on the floors of the Brazilian parliament and could possibly fix the current economic crisis."

BRA_Fourth_Republic:0 "The 1949 Spring Democracy"
BRA_Fourth_Republic_desc:0 "The Fourth Brazilian Republic was established in March, 1949, after the coup d'état deposing Gétulio Vargas and ending the dictatorship known as the Estado Novo. The leader of the coup, Eurico Gaspar Dutra, while conservative, saw the benefit of hiding the military presence behind the Brazilian state under a blanket of democracy. Thus, the Fourth Republic was born. While simply an attempt to hide the military pressure, the Fourth Republic has become popular among the middle class of Brazil, which had been vocally in favour of liberal reforms and democracy since the 1930s. The 1949 Spring Republic, being a nickname for the Fourth Republic, has therefore been cemented as a popular democracy, even if the army dances it around like a puppet."
Muddy_Sea_of_Corruption:0 "Muddy Sea of Corruption"
Muddy_Sea_of_Corruption_desc:0 "Brazil isn't inexperienced on the topic of corruption: Since its independence from Portugal, Brazil has been a corrupt nation from the top to the bottom. The local elite of Brazil has known the language of money for several decades now and has become fluent in it since the fall of the Empire. The Brazilian Republics experienced corruption as if it was a daily routine and the Fourth Republic, established after the fall of Vargas in 1949, would be no different. Corruption on the parliamentary floors has made actual democracy hard to maintain, as every vote can be bought for the right price. Vargas' presidency has seen an increase in corruption accusations from all sides and Vargas himself has called the corruption situation a ‘Muddy Sea'. Only an experienced and ambitious leader could probably make a start on fixing the grand corruption problem that has consumed Brazilian politics like a plague."
The_Intervention_Doctrine:0 "The Intervention Doctrine"
The_Intervention_Doctrine_desc:0 "The Armed Forces of Brazil adopted an important doctrine in the last dying days of the Brazilian Empire, namely the doctrine of military intervention. Unlike most military doctrines known across Europe, Asia and the Americas, the intervention doctrine is purely political. The doctrine mainly focuses on crisis situations that could destabilize Brazil and/or lead to Brazil aligning with radicals that oppose the current military status quo. This doctrine of intervention has not been unused by the army: Brazil has experienced 3 military coups and juntas in roughly 60 years and the armed forces will not stop their interventionist doctrine any time soon."

BRA_Vargas:0 "Vargas' Ministry of Experience"
BRA_Vargas_desc:0 "The Esteemed Leader, Getúlio Vargas, reigns sovereign over Brazil; his long experience in politics and his willingness to bend the ears of the masses for the sake of the Nation have made him practically invulnerable for as long as he has the reins of power. In his previous term as leader, Vargas was weakened by accusations of corruption, populism, fascism: no more. The new Brazil he shapes will be an everlasting rebuke to all his critics. \n\nAnd the perfection of its system shall silence them forever."

BRA_Petrobras_desc:0 "We have been invested with valuable oil reserves off our coast and along our shores; how, then, to ensure the revenues of extraction do not fall into the hands of a few while exploiting the common good? The answer is Petrobras, a firm dedicated to the national production and sale of oil, and with government hands firmly guiding its every move, we have every confidence that the Brazilian oil industry will flourish."

Bringing musky, smoky warmth to the lives of millions in the Western world, the coffee plantations of Brazil represent our greatest food export, and we must capitalise on the ever-growing hunger for this stimulating beverage. The Brazilian Coffee Institute, tied to the Ministry of Trade and Commerce, will be responsible for regulating the complex supply chains that take coffee supplies from harvesting through processing to shipping, ensuring we stay competitive and on top of current market trends."
BRA_Adress_the_Northeastern_Drought:0 "Address the Northeastern Drought"
BRA_Adress_the_Northeastern_Drought_desc:0 "Despite our flourishing flora and fauna, we are extremely prone to droughts, particularly in the semi-arid environments of our Northeast. The present crisis requires large-scale action, and fast: the introduction of federal water management agencies, emergency redirection of nearby reservoir supplies and the creation of a Bank of Northeast Brazil will help farmers cope with what could otherwise be a career-ending event."
BRA_Import_Licensing:0 "Import Licensing"
BRA_Import_Licensing_desc:0 "We have traditionally set up strict import barriers on primary goods entering our country to boost our own industries, and the introduction of import licencing will assist with this process while giving our government control over the firms which get access to our markets. By granting select industries import licence, we will aid their innovation and mass-production while limiting the inflation endemic to other nations in Latin America."
BRA_Nationalize_Oil_Industry:0 "‘The Oil is Ours' Campaign"
BRA_Nationalize_Oil_Industry_desc:0 "Under the slogan "o petróleo é nosso", we founded Petrobras for the masses - now that we have a suitable instrument of domestic energy policy, we will boost domestic demand by encouraging the use of oil for all manner of daily activities! Transports that are not motorized will be restricted in their usage, and the casual use of oil to fuel domestic industry will be heavily subsidized. If you got it, flaunt it - and even if you don't have it, buy it in huge quantities and flaunt it anyway!"
BRA_American_Military_Aid:0 "Military Aid from Washington"
BRA_American_Military_Aid_desc:0 "We are as dependent as ever on our American friends; despite their distinct lack of congeniality to the Atlantic fascists, they are at least willing to do business with our untapped markets and massive mineral reserves.

BRA_Rally_the_Nationalists:0 "Rally the Nationalists"
BRA_Rally_the_Nationalists_desc:0 "The only thing standing between the Army and the coup they so desperately desire is the will of the people. It seems logical enough to appeal to the Nationalists in our support base to hold off any possibility of a popular coup, and we will do so by organizing massive rallies around the Republic where we will link Vargas with the security interests of this country. A little gavel-bashing against the Enemies of the Republic won't hurt either."
BRA_German_Ambassador_Crisis:0 "The German Ambassador Crisis"
BRA_German_Ambassador_Crisis_desc:0 "We believed, as Geutilio Vargas entered office, that he would be infallible, and that the government of his New Order was stable beyond any man's capacity to derail it.

And who can blame them for trying? Vargas was thrown out of power and survived; in the face of ambitious generals, unruly mobs, and a fearful America, he alone has survived in the political scene - he is the political immortal, unkillable, unstoppable.  \n\nMany men have tried to seize the future. Only Vargas now stands to shape it."
BRA_focus_on_the_Brazilian_industry:0 "National Economics"
BRA_focus_on_the_Brazilian_industry_desc:0 "Our trademark mix of a nationalized approach to key sectors of the economy and a free market anywhere else is the key to success in Brazil. But nationalism does not come easy in a country dominated by its foreign interests as it is by its jungles - we must be ambitious and careful if we are to build an economy that truly looks to the future, instead of getting trapped in the past. The future of our country - and our people - hang in the balance."
BRA_Adress_the_Labour_Issue:0 "Issue of the Working Man"
BRA_Adress_the_Labour_Issue_desc:0 "We have yoked our carriage to the stallions of the working class; to drop the reins now would be essentially suicidal. We shall look to resolving labor disputes, promoting a third way of governing the middle-class economy, and promoting cooperation between companies and unions to keep wages fair and work smooth. Of course, we might have to toss in some token legislation to make things nice and formal, but that is basically what Vargas' position is for, yes?"
BRA_Promote_Urbanization:0 "Construct Planned Cities"
BRA_Promote_Urbanization_desc:0 "There are plans afoot for the reinvention of the Brazilian city: we will, in the wildlands of our interior, build vast open-space conurbations that are designed to look, feel and act modern. In the place of cramped suburbs new, stately towers will rise, and their centres of government will have concrete shells to rival the Pyramids in their majesty. These will serve as monuments for our progress, and as a promise to a future age: Brazil will build a bridge to tomorrow, no matter how long it takes."
BRA_The_Neglected_Peasantry:0 "Increase Crop Yield"
BRA_The_Neglected_Peasantry_desc:0 "With a Revolution in the City, it is only fair that we have a Revolution in the Fields as well. What is being called the Green Explosion by our experts has increased crop productivity through chemical manipulation, careful use of phosphorus-based fertilizers and careless use of pesticides. We will invest heavily in all these measures and fund farmers through development banks, turning Brazil into the farm of the world! "
BRA_Nationalize_Power_Plants:0 "Nationalize Energy Production"
BRA_Nationalize_Power_Plants_desc:0 "Our nation will live, work and play on our energy supplies: the use of coal, oil, gas and the power of water quite literally keeps this nation going. But economic crises and foreign instability make these energy supplies unstable - we will need a permanent solution. A nationalisation of this key industry will keep the wolves and jackals away from the lifeblood of Brazil, and those that disagree with our choice are more than welcome to take it up with us."
BRA_explore_the_untouched_frontier:0 "Industrialize the Amazones"
BRA_explore_the_untouched_frontier_desc:0 "Wild beauty, spectacular wildlife, the Garden of Eden made anew in the Southern American continent. That is how the jungles of the Amazones are described; in truth, however, they are also a massive headache for our livestock farms and a waste of perfectly good industrial space. We will begin the clearing of the Basin, little by little, to build homes for our households where raw jungle once stood; it's not like we have to answer to plants and apes, in any event..."
BRA_Connect_the_Regions:0 "Improve Rural Connections"
BRA_Connect_the_Regions_desc:0 "The Republic grows in tendrils of light, reaching from city to city, town to town, but the glow of electric warmth has so far escaped our rural areas. A move to full-scale infrastructural production will aid our gradual colonization of our vast hinterland, turning villages into towns, towns into cities and dirt roads into highways. Soon the whole of Brazil will glow in the dark, in a strictly non-radioactive fashion."
BRA_Surpress_government_opposition:0 "The Threat of Integralism"
BRA_Surpress_government_opposition_desc:0 "We once hesitated to take action against the broad ranging Integralist movement, that band of esoteric ultra-Catholic fanatics - now that Vargas has secured a virtually uncontested grip on Brazilian politics, the time for fear is over. This is our country, we will define its future, and these pissants who think themselves the harbingers of God's Kingdom in Brazil will repent of their social deviancy - or we will break their movement so utterly it will be as if God Himself had wiped them from the Book of Life."
BRA_Placate_the_Democrats:0 "Manage the Social Democrats"
BRA_Placate_the_Democrats_desc:0 "One of Vargas' biggest support bases is the Social Democratic movement in Brazil, proclaiming a broad swathe of progressive ideas while firmly opposing Communist infiltration. We will make continued promises towards the progressives, inclusive of continued education and healthcare reform, while keeping them at arms' length. We can never, after all, afford to attach ourselves too clearly to one boat or the other, lest the whole enterprise sink in imbalance."
BRA_Criminalize_the_Communist_Party:0 "Criminalize the Communist Party"
BRA_Criminalize_the_Communist_Party_desc:0 "The last major electoral threat to our rule is the Brazilian Communist Party - well, not a threat precisely, but their activities underground constitute the largest single national security threat that is non-separatist. We will decisively clamp down on the Communist movement here, examining everything from union assemblies to ties with the Catholic Church's more leftist members - those that do not recant will be expelled from the Nation for their irresponsible beliefs."
BRA_I_leave_life_to_enter_history:0 "I leave Life to enter History"
BRA_I_leave_life_to_enter_history_desc:0 "The curtain falls on the Vargas Presidency. Weeping fathers and mothers watch as the late President is prepared for burial, and demonstrations rock Brazil. The Republic must now prepare itself for a future without the Leader...and the coming of the man who will take his place."
BRA_Improve_Oil_Production:0 "Improve Oil Production"
BRA_Improve_Oil_Production_desc:0 "As Petrobras continues to centralize and improve the efficiency of our oil production process, we will gently push them along their way by encouraging select imports of foreign technology to further our refining processes. Methods like the induction tool and induction array, which allow us to scan for oil deposits further from the initial boreholes we dig, will maximize the value of this industry - and the Brazilian people will reap the profits."
BRA_Modern_Brazil:0 "A Modern Brazil"
BRA_Modern_Brazil_desc:0 "As favelas are cleared in Rio De Janeiro, families weep with joy to see their new apartments. Roads and Railways glisten from the northern coasts to the southern cities, carrying passengers flush with cash and ready to spend it. Cities gleam with new additions of commercial and civic buildings, and there are plans for a jewel at Brazil's heart itself, a city to be named after the great nation she will be the capital of. \n\nAcross the nation, our citizens toil and play for the future; and its shape bears forever the imprint of our Great Leader, Vargas, the Founder, the Pioneer - the Builder."
BRA_Begin_Brasilia_desc:0 "Begin Construction of Brasilia"
BRA_Begin_Brasilia_desc:0 "Since 1891, our constitution has states that Brazil must have a new capital in the centre of the country to replace the growing Rio de Janeiro. Now, with our immediate needs in the country met, we can begin to fufill this promise. The new city of Brasilia will one day stand as a new capital for our nation!"

BRA_UDN:0 "União Democrática Nacional"
BRA_UDN_desc:0 "The UDN, Brazil's second-largest party in the Vargas era, has taken power in Brazil, promising a firm and steady hand in guiding Brazil forward. Many in Rio De Janeiro say that the Uniao, far from their promises of unity, are divided over everything except our name - that we have socialist and centrist elements sparring within us to determine the direction of our internal policy.\n\nNothing, of course, could be further from the truth. The UDN has received a clear mandate that our government must keep Brazil's markets free, our shores clear of enemies, and our streets clear of the tainted populism that once strangled Brazil. We intend to carry that policy out in full."
BRA_Udenismo:0 "The Udenismo Doctrine"
BRA_Udenismo_desc:0 "We rose to power on the wallets and upheld arms of the army and middle class. To deviate from their interests would be a folly of follies, and to outright attack them would be political suicide. Thankfully, the new Brazilian bourgeois are not hard to please: economic progress, public morality and the politics of principle will be the razor-sharp focus of our regime. Brazil shall build a free, better and prosperous life - all that is needed is the courage to work it into being!"
BRA_decentralize_power:0 "Balance Regional Powers"
BRA_decentralize_power_desc:0 "Our Federal system has long been a source of pride - we tell visitors that while the Yankees to the north hold their fat-bellied states to ransom, we in Brazil leave our states free to develop. This has come at a cost, however: regionalism, asymmetrical development and faction-politics is damaging our economy and our national unity, not to mention giving our banks massive headaches when attempting to regulate the flow of national currency. We will step in and impose limits on federal state autonomy, in hopes that whatever we come up with next will be better."
BRA_Connect_Regions:0 "Highways along the Coast"
BRA_Connect_Regions_desc:0 "As we pacify our state governors, our Transport Ministry has come up with a grand set of plans to keep them in line for the next few years - highways! The nightmare of traversing the Amazon has always been the biggest limit to regional development in Brazil, and the sea-lanes that are our next best option are expensive to use. A network of regional highways will make trade between our cities viable, profitable and secure - not to mention serving as a viable source of pork-barrel funding, should the need ever arise for it."
BRA_Increase_Education_Budget:0 "Higher Standards of Education"
BRA_Increase_Education_Budget_desc:0 "Brazilian education has consistently lagged behind our continental rival, Argentina - the absolute horror! - due to a fractured and impoverished education system. Comprehensive reform will be necessary if we are ever to develop the schools of Brazil's future, starting with the standardization of public school curricula and their updating to modern, scientific standards. Some have also spoken of schooling in the Montessori format - if they are correct, perhaps the men and women of tomorrow can truly be trained from birth."
BRA_Defender_against_Populism:0 "Denounce Vargas Populism"
BRA_Defender_against_Populism_desc:0 "The UDN will never bow to the will of a single man, much less allow him to ride on the base fears and desires of the masses - our struggle against Vargas showed us how corrosive populism can be to the institutions that keep Brazil safe and secure. Constitutional safeguards and internal party-restructuring will ensure that no single man will ever seize control of the reins of state again, and firm term-limits and legislative restrictions will prevent adventurists from using our people as a weapon."
BRA_Friendly_Ties_with_the_Military:0 "Allies with the Army"
BRA_Friendly_Ties_with_the_Military_desc:0 "Our ties to the generals of the Army are more than handshakes and formal dances - we have sponsored the generous commercial estates of many senior military men, linking their families with the bureaucratic networks of Rio, and this relationship must continue to grow if we are to keep our power base stable. Expanded military budgets, investment into strategic military pension funds and a generous scholarship scheme for the officer class will make Brazil a nation of modern major generals!"
BRA_Keep_Communism_Away:0 "Brazil without Communism"
BRA_Keep_Communism_Away_desc:0 "The Red Star could never support Brazil and it never will. Bolshevist tyranny failed in Russia, and we would be fools to allow this failed experiment to blossom anew on our shores. A few poor souls, however, cling still to the deluded hope of Lenin - their Party must be wiped off the face of Brazil if we are ever to preserve the liberties we have won here. Constitutional bans on Communism, mass arrests of Socialist demonstrations, and very long sentences for those found guilty of unionism will ensure that this damnable idea never takes root."
BRA_Keep_Communism_in_Check:0 "Regulate the Communist Party"
BRA_Keep_Communism_in_Check_desc:0 "It is not our place to control the minds and hearts of our people, as Vargas once aimed to do - even so, anyone can see the threat Socialism poses to our way of life. Strict restrictions on literally everything our Communist Party does, from meeting size to internal communications, will keep these saboteurs in line with the Constitution. Internal surveillance networks and massive infiltration will neuter their work from the top-down as well - after all, no one would ascribe to sabotage what can more plausibly be attributed to stupidity."
BRA_Support_American_Business:0 "American Business in Rio"
BRA_Support_American_Business_desc:0 "Washington has never been the most reliable of friends, but as financial partners they are hard to beat. We will welcome their foreign investments, especially in our undeveloped agricultural and livestock industries, and push them for valuable commercial technology in the bargain - not to mention the diplomatic advantages of proximity to the Western superpower. Let us hope that we can fend off their political influence better than our neighbours..."
BRA_Ban_Salgados_Party:0 "Ban Salgado's Integralists"
BRA_Ban_Salgados_Party_desc:0 "What have the damned Integralists ever done for Brazil, and what on earth makes them popular in the first place? They are nothing but populist savages who thirst for the blood of everyone who is different from them, democrats and socialists alike, and their supposed anti-Racism is nothing but a veil for their lust for naked tyranny. They would claim the State under the auspices of the Church, and rip our country apart under God's holy name - may they be anathema, and may their sentences in our maximum-security jails be without end!"
BRA_Go_with_Kubitschek:0 "Go with Kubitschek"
BRA_Go_with_Kubitschek_desc:0 "Juscelino Kubitzchek, our new President, is not a man known for moderation in ambition. His slogan, "Fifty Years of Progress in Five!", has raised eyebrows all across Brazil - and yet, seeing his comprehensive plans for education, transport, energy, industry and agriculture, it is hard not to believe him. Kubitzchek's reformist agenda will begin with the rapid reshuffle of the ministries, revising and rationalising them to be more efficient: the wisdom of this move will become evident as the progress of our initiatives continues."

BRA_Go_with_Jango_desc:0 "Joao Belchior Marques Goulart, or Jango for short, was once Vargas' right-hand man with the Unions, passing some of the most comprehensive labor-management laws Brazil had ever known as Minister for Labor. Vargas is dead, but his dream of a united and progressive Brazil lives on with the President - a set of comprehensive reforms, titled the Reforms De Base, will target everything from capital flight to land distribution in Brazilian society. Brazil is ready for the future, and Jango is ready to lead them there."

BRA_Central_Health_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "The centrepiece of Kubitzchek's reform agenda is healthcare: despite our relative prosperity as a nation our hospitals have stagnated since the Great War, and infant mortality is still distressingly high despite the protests of the Church. We will restructure our hospitals by strengthening our healthcare staffers with more administrative support - nurses and doctors will maintain centralized databases, specialized institutes will be established for rural areas, and treatment protocols will be standardized to ensure technical competency in our therapists."

BRA_Keep_the_Military_Happy_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to keep the military in line, we are fully aware of the limited pull our party has with our generals. The answer to this, of course, is pork-barrel politics - a man will never raise a gun to the source of his wealth. Generous schemes to subsidize military spending, increase soldier payouts, and give generals' children scholarships abroad will hopefully keep them happy and neuter their political ambitions."

This does not mean, however, that we will allow the neo-imperialist powers of West and East to siphon our national resources at will! Through the forced association of foreign investment money to domestic capital assets, we will ensure that our factories and fields will receive the attention due them, and receive a healthy balance of payments in the bargain."

BRA_Honour_Vargas_Populism_desc:0 "Vargas was the founder of our party, and it was Vargas that laid the foundations for the united Brazilian state whose welfare we now pursue. While some of his actions might not have been entirely altruistic, or even beneficial, we must acknowledge his progressive vision for the nation.

twrbrazil.0.t:0 "Brazil in 1952"
twrbrazil.0.d:0 "South America's largest country, Brazil, is in an interesting geopolitical position going into the 1950s. Once dictator Getúlio Vargas, having already led the nation from 1930 to the mid-1940s, was recently elected as President and now rules democratically. Having been personally inspired by European fascism and modelling into his own corporatist 'New State' ideology, Vargas and the Brazilian government as a whole has since the 1930s sometimes seemed uncomfortably close to the Axis powers. At the same time however, economic links to the western hemisphere's hegemon, the United States, have been strong, to the benefit of Brazil, and the Brazilian state has avoided drifting too obviously in the direction of Germania so as not to draw the ire of a Washington that increasingly seeks to isolate Nazi-controlled Europe.\n\nThere are many different factions in Brazil, each supporting their own directions in domestic and foreign policy, with their own benefits and risks. The decisions Brazil makes in the near future will guide its course and fortunes."
twrbrazil.0.a:0 "Ordem e progresso!"
twrbrazil.1.t:0 "The Shot that silenced Brazil"
twrbrazil.1.d:0 "Getúlio Vargas, one of the great pillars of Brazilian history, has been found dead in his room after taking his own life this night. Vargas' failure to solve the German ambassador crisis prompted by the anti-German riots prompted his General Staff to force his resignation, as many feared Vargas' heavy handed approach would damage Brazil's neutrality in the cold war. Vargas accepted their orders on the condition that they would be able to keep stability and order after the weeks of chaos Brazil had experienced.\n\nThe General Staff and his ministers agreed to these terms and Vargas left for his apartment in the south of Rio de Janeiro. His last words would be to the minister of justice, Tancredo Neves, after gifting him a gold pen, telling him: \"I've lost all hope in the situation and can only hope to be remembered as a valiant warrior, not a stable president\". Vargas would be found dead the next morning, immediately after shooting himself in the chest, found by General Caiado and Tancredo Neves after hearing the president fall on the floor above. \n\nThe impact of Vargas' suicide is clearly seen across Brazil. In the wake of chaos, grieving crowds mourn the death of Brazil's most recognizable man of the 1900s. While his family has refused to hold a public burial, João Goulart has vetoed their wishes and has planned Vargas' burial to be held in public, giving the Brazilian people the opportunity to see the man that moulded the Brazilian Republic one last time."
twrbrazil.1.a:0 "I leave life to enter history..."
twrbrazil.2.t:0 "Mob storms German Embassy"
twrbrazil.2.d:0 "Anti-German sentiment among the Brazilian middle class has always been rather strong since the end of the German-UK war: Germany and its authoritarian regime is the perfect counterpart to the growing liberal movement among the Brazilian middle class, which pressured the Estado Novo in the late 1940s to liberalize the regime. Today, however, this sentiment spilled over as the German ambassador to Brazil, Karl Ritter, was attacked by a mob of Brazilian workers. Karl Ritter was able to safely flee to the German embassy before the mob was able to capture him. However, the mob did not dispatch nor did it become any less fierce: it continued to riot and did significant damage to the embassy. Karl Ritter has now plead Vargas to send in the military police to break up the mob, before they break down the doors of the embassy."
twrbrazil.2.a:0 "Send the military"
twrbrazil.2.b:0 "The Germans had it coming for a long time..."
twrbrazil.3.t:0 "Karl Ritter demands an International Apology"
twrbrazil.3.d:0 "The dust of the anti-German mob has yet to settle as the German ambassador to Brazil, Karl Ritter, demands an international apology from Gétulio Vargas. He claims to have undergone extreme stress and shock last week during the siege of the German embassy and has remarked that he wouldn't have had to experience such emotional damage if the Brazilian government was actually able to control its people. His sarcastic tone has clearly struck a chord in the military, as many officers persuade Vargas to not cave to Ritter's demands. A small portion of the pro-German military, however, seems to be sympathetic towards Ritter: they haven't demanded Vargas to listen to the snarky ambassador, but their German sympathies are still clear as day."
twrbrazil.3.a:0 "An international apology will be fine"
twrbrazil.3.b:0 "He's lucky that he made it out alive, let alone without any physical damage"
twrbrazil.4.t:0 "Pro-American Faction detains Ritter"
twrbrazil.4.d:0 "The recent apology for not being able to keep the German ambassador to Brazil safe may have been accepted by the German Reich, it clearly was not an accepted option to the Brazilian armed forces: A group of pro-American personel under the leadership of Eduardo Gomes have taken their chances this midnight and detained Karl Ritter, demanding Vargas to resign from his presidential position. They cite his weak leadership as the main problem tearing Brazil apart and have gone as far as claiming that Vargas' authoritarian sympathies towards Nazi-Germany threaten the essence of Brazilian democracy established in 1949 after the end of the Estado Novo. While it isn't a technical hostage situation yet, Vargas can clearly see the potential of this event to turn into either a national or an international crisis of proportion."
twrbrazil.4.a:0 "I'll have to resign..."
twrbrazil.4.b:0 "I'll only leave the presidency when I'm dead!"
twrbrazil.5.t:0 "The Gomes Junta"
twrbrazil.5.d:0 "As Vargas hands in his resignation to the Brazilian parliament, storms Eduardo Gomes into the same building. Followed by a small personal guard, he announces that the Brazilian parliament is surrounded by troops loyal to him and his military faction fighting against radicalism in Brazil. With this news, it becomes quite clear to the politicians present that Gomes has orchestrated a coup against the young Brazilian government in its time of weakness after Vargas' resignation. Gomes thus declares himself the new Brazilian president for life, basically ending the Brazilian democracy established in 1949 and replacing it with a military dictatorship of his own, loyal to Brazil and the Toronto Accord."
twrbrazil.5.a:0 "A warm welcome to the new president!"
twrbrazil.6.t:0 "Ritter leaves Brazil"
twrbrazil.6.d:0 "After Vargas' baffling response to his demands for an international apology to the German Reich, Ritter has decided to end his diplomatic career in Brazil. He has taken the first plane going to Germania, continueing to mock any Brazilian he comes across for their weak government. His departure has been celebrated by Vargas' cabinet."
twrbrazil.6.a:0 "Goodbye Ritter, nobody will miss you!"
twrbrazil.7.t:0 "Ritter leaves Brazil"
twrbrazil.7.d:0 "Vargas' refusal to send in the armed forces was a clearly a tactical move by the president: While the mob was hostile, it wasn't able to break through the baricade set up by the German soldiers inside the embassy, keeping Karl Ritter safe from the angry Brazilian liberals. However, Karl Ritter clearly didn't understand the tactical genius of Vargas' decision, as the only response Vargas got was furious German from the ambassador. He left Brazil the same day, declaring that Brazil is not a nation worthy of the Aryan Reich."
twrbrazil.7.a:0 "He could use some yoga..."
twrbrazil.8.t:0 "Ritter murdered by Brazilian Mob"
twrbrazil.8.d:0 "News from the German embassy has shocked Gétulio Vargas: Karl Ritter, the German ambassador to Brazil, has been killed and mutilated by the angry Brazilian mob. \n\nSeveral hours after the decision to not send the armed forces, the Brazilian mob was able to break through the make-shift barricade set up by the German soldiers of the embassy, leading to many wounded and dead on both sides. However, the most important death was that of Karl Ritter, as he was found in his room by the angry mob praying for his life. His torture was luckily very short, as he was accidentally killed by the mob after falling from the third story window. His body was then paraded across the streets of Rio de Janeiro, resembling Hector's body being paraded by Achilles in the Illiad. His death will surely lead to an unfortunate future for Brazil and Vargas, as the sympathies of the pro-German faction inside the army won't tolerate such neglect."
twrbrazil.8.a:0 "Oh god..."
twrbrazil.9.t:0 "Monteiro demands Vargas' resignation"
twrbrazil.9.d:0 "Gois Monteiro has been an interesting figure in the Brazilian military, leading the pro-German faction that believes in German global hegemony and that Brazil should align itself with the German Reich. His faction, known simply as the pro-German faction in the cabinet, has been disturbed by the gruesome death of Karl Ritter, the former German ambassador, and has blamed Vargas for the neglect of the German ambassador in his time of need. While they haven't been the biggest military faction prior to the crisis, the death of Ritter has shifted the balance of power, as many moderately right-wing officers join Monteiro's faction against Vargas."
twrbrazil.9.a:0 "I'll have to resign..."
twrbrazil.9.b:0 "I'll only leave the presidency when I'm dead!"
twrbrazil.10.t:0 "The Monteiro Junta"
twrbrazil.10.d:0 "Vargas' resignation has been the perfect opportunity for Gois Monteiro, as the leader of the pro-German faction used the event to overthrow the Brazilian democracy. \n\nAfter Vargas had handed in his resign and left parliament, Monteiro's troops opened the doors and walked into the room. Monteiro quickly declared the parliamentary building surrounded by troops loyal to his faction, declaring an end to the corrupt democracy established by Dutra in 1949. Few politicians dared to even speak during his declaration, as the troops loyal to Monteiro swiftly closed all doors leading to an exit. The parliament has thus voted in favour of Monteiro becoming the next Brazilian president (with 100% of the votes in favour and 0% against)."
twrbrazil.10.a:0 "A warm welcome to the new leader!"
twrbrazil.11.a:0 "The Vargas government survived!"
twrbrazil.11.t:0 "End of the Crisis"
twrbrazil.11.d:0 "With Karl Ritter leaving Brazil, the German embassy is temporarily closed. While his departure has soured relations with the German Reich, it has showed to the Brazilian armed forces that Vargas' rule is far from unstable and that Vargas is quite able to guide Brazil through tough times. The armed forces have thus relaxed after their alert state during the crisis, thus cementing Vargas' rule as stable president. The interventionist doctrine, however, hasn't discredited by Vargas' diplomatic skills and the military remains quite a threat to Brazilian democracy in the case of a crisis."
twrbrazil.12.t:0 "The 1956 Elections"
twrbrazil.12.d:0 "With the end of Vargas' 4-year term, Brazil experiences its third election since the establishment of the Fourth Republic. Due to the Fifth Brazilian constitution of 1950, Vargas isn't allowed to run for president this election, though has promised to return for the 1960 election. The main parties involved in the elections are the anti-Vargas UDN, which has endorsed air marshal Eduardo Gomes as president, and the pro-Vargas PTB and PSD, which have both endorsed Juscelino Kubitschek and João ‘Jango' Goulart as the succesor of the popular Vargas."
twrbrazil.12.a:0 "Kubitschek won the election!"
twrbrazil.12.b:0 "Goulart won the election!"
twrbrazil.12.c:0 "Salgado won the election!"
twrbrazil.12.e:0 "Gomes won the election!"
twrbrazil.13.t:0 "Apply to the TA?"
twrbrazil.13.d:0 "As we push for closer relations to the United States, the obvious end point of this is membership of the Toronto Accord. This would undoubtedly cement our alliance with Washington and bolster our security, but at the same time it could risk dragging us into European affairs. Shall we apply to join?"

twrbrazil.17.d:0 "The USA has been nothing but a nuisance when it comes to our economic policy with the German Reich. With the Reich's constant need for more and more fuel, it is a prime ground for us to profit off and boost our economy. \n\nBut as of late, the US Navy has been intercepting more and more of our transport ships heading to the Reich, causing our sales of oil and fuel to plunder quickly and we must do something immediatelly to address this! \n\nThe Naval Commission along with a few German naval advisors have come up with two operations, Operation Spill and Operation Fishing Trip. Proposed by a German U-Boat Officer, Operation Spill proposes the usage of modified U-Boats from Germany to transfer massive amounts of oil covertly, using the technology of submarines as to avoid US naval patrols. But this plan has been adviced against, as if the Americans discover the submarines, it is highly likely that they will come after us. \n\nMade by our own Chief of Navy, Augusto Rademaker, Operation Fishing Trip proposes the usage of smaller fishing and transport vessels disguised as simple fish trading ships heading to France while in truth they would carry our petrol. Of course, while this plan is far safer it is also far less effective and thus our profits will be cut by quite some."

While unclear, these reports have been nothing but worrying and with the Monteiro Junta being quite Pro-German in its policies, they are rightfully so. \n\nDuring an emergency Pentagon meeting with the Heads of the CIA and the Naval Command, there were two approaches to this problem, the approach of direct intervention and the approach of ignorance. While the CIA were adamant in pushing to coup the Monteiro junta and establish a US puppet regime, the Naval Command has recommended we stand down. The approach of the Naval Command derives from the avoidance of starting another war with Germany or Brazil over some old U-Boats, advicing that anything outside of a political protest, military intervention would lead to nothing but trouble."

Leading a militia of defecting soldiers, mercenaries and citizens, Eduardo Gomes has been fighting throughout the streets of the capital in his attempt to take down the Junta of Monteiro. Backed by US funding and mercenaries, the Gomes militia have proven to be quite troublesome, causing major losses in the first fights against the Monteiro soldiers. \n\nNow, it is uncertain who will come out victorious but its up to who wins the most battles that will prove victorious."

The Representative sends his regards as well, and hopes that Herr Ambassador has recovered from his recent fever. \n\nWe write in the distressing news that the heroism of the German people and your rightful Government has been threatened by the overwhelming monstrosities of the Jewish-Bolshevik Internationalist Menace, and that victory will be inevitably delayed. We wish to convey our most sincere material and financial support, as far as we are able given our limited resources - but our representatives are now authorized to offer a more substantial proposal. \n\nIn the documents attached, hereby named OPERATION KONDOR-GERMANIA, we can offer a covert retrieval of material and manpower assets from selected areas of the Atlantic. Should it be necessary to relocate your Government, rest assured that our Army and nation are pure of heart and heroic in virtue, and will protect your glorious Government until the beauty of Fascism can sprout anew in German soil. \n\nWe hope you will consider this Proposal - it is an honor to offer this extraordinary measure, and we are of the fullest confidence that you will come to accept it in time. \n\nYours,\n\nGois Monteiro, Prime Minister of the Republic of Brazil."
twrbrazil.21.a:0 "We can always use other bases of operations."
twrbrazil.22.t:0 "They Actually Came to Brazil!"
twrbrazil.22.d:0 "Gois Monteiro seldom looks at his papers; he thinks himself a man of action, and in any case the fledgeling Fascist state he must nurture to adulthood demands most of his attention. From disciplining rogue officers (who do not often make it out alive) to whipping the German companies' affiliates into shape, Monteiro considers it his pride to be so busy, and a joy to know that his work never goes to waste. \n\nToday, however, is an exception. Recent news from the Reich confirm the silent testimony of IG Farben's increasingly scant reports and worried briefings by liaisons. The German brothers, it seems, are doomed to fall, and with them will go the last real diplomatic ally the Republic has on either side of the Pacific. Their liaisons have outstretched tendrils to Brazil for aid - and for refuge, should the former prove insufficient. \n\nGois frowns and examines the policy option placed before him. One, titled only OPERATION KONDOR, claims that a diplomatic solution is possible; within its pages are the details of a bold rescue plan to sieve the German leadership from the Atlantic and bring them into Brazil, where they will be safe from the scrutiny of the Judeo-Bolsheviks once and for all. There is a certain appeal to this plan; if Germany is truly the last bastion of pure government in the world, then it would make sense to hold their remnants like a seed-bank until the time is ripe to let Fascism flourish anew on old soils. \n\nThe Reich's government has issued a tentative agreement - and there is little reason to believe, as the news from Germany grows ever darker, that they will rescind their lifeline. Monteiro nods, leaves the document aside, and announces that he will be taking a walk. \n\nThere will be plenty of time for diplomatic niceties when the Germans arrive in earnest."

twrbrazil.23.t:0 "A New Life in Another Germania"
twrbrazil.23.d:0 "Reinhard Gehlen chuckled as he struggled with his suitcases, there on the cramped cruiser-turned-refugee-ship: he'd gotten the chance of a lifetime, and by God he'd taken it. Those damned fools in the Reich's former territories were going to hang upside down, but here he was, preparing for a life in the tropical sun! More proof that Social Darwinism extended not just to races, but to individuals as well - the stupid ones died first, just as it had been on the Eastern Front. \n\nGehlen had been skeptical at first; hell, the ports hadn't even been open when he received the letter. 'A Select Minority Of The Loyal', his ass: hell, hadn't the ones who ended up surrendering to the Enemy been the poor sods who had to manage the last Battalions? It was just as well that he'd gotten himself into a cushy office job after the chaos of entering Moscow. \n\nWaving irritably at the smoke coming in from an adjacent cabin, Gehlen looked again at the pamphlet, giggling to himself. Tanned women - god, it had been 20 fucking years since he'd had a good look at good-looking women outside the General Staff secretaries - beaches, and a good, strong government who seemed doggedly loyal to the Reich even in defeat. He'd hit the buffets with this Prime Minister Monteiro fellow, grab just enough to justify his presence, and then it would be off to the beaches for this one. \n\nAnd there were matters of...business to discuss as well. He looked at the other invitation he'd gotten, this one in a much thicker dossier: the GEHLEN ORGANIZATION OFFER, it read. Reinhard turned serious. Sun, women and waves aside, Brazil would be a good place to start recruiting the men he was looking for: men who would, one day, bring about the collapse of the Enemy from within."

twrbranews.1.d:0 "The recent German ambassador crisis that hit Brazil has ended in good news, for Vargas' cabinet, military and Brazil as a whole. \n\nThe crisis started several weeks ago with the storming of the German embassy by a Brazilian mob, endangering Karl Ritter, the German ambassador to Brazil. The resultant anti-German riots in Rio de Janeiro and other southern Brazilian cities eventually ended, but Ritter has departed from Brazil an embittered man, temporarily closing the German embassy in Rio and seriously souring relations with Germany. The Brazilian army, which has been known to intervene in national politics and crises, later promised Vargas that it would keep itself out of the crisis, returning stability to Brazil and guaranteeing a few more years for the fragile Brazilian democracy."

Acting president Vargas, under the pressure of pro-German, pro-Brazilian and pro-American factions in his military and electorate, was forced to resign by the armed forces under the threat of a military coup.\n\nSources close to the President report his deep heartbreak at his inability to resolve the demonstrations shaking major Brazilian cities, possibly a clue to his last action: Using a Colt Police Positive Special, Vargas left his life to enter history with a bullet to the heart. João Goulart has decreed a public burial to commemorate one of the most controversial and celebrated lives in Brazilian history."

After President Vargas' public apology to Ambassador Karl Ritter, Eduardo Gomes and his military faction took it upon themselves to change the course of Brazilian foreign policy by detaining the German ambassador. Under attack from Gomes and Brazil's militarists for destroying the dignity of the Presidency, Vargas has formally resigned: in his wake military personnel have occupied Parliament and seized the presidency for Gomes.\n\nUnder President Gomes, Brazil is guaranteed to align itself with the Toronto Accord, as Gomes' pro-American faction has repeatedly shown sympathies for the TA's cause against Nazi-Germany."

The recent crisis surrounding the death of the German ambassador to Brazil, Karl Ritter, triggered pro-German and moderate independent factions inside the army to collaborate and force the resignation of former president Gétulio Vargas.\n\nSeveral hours after Vargas formally left his Parliamentary position, Monteiro's forces violently secured the building – Monteiro has declared himself President in a unanimous vote, and is expected to begin diplomatic talks with Germania next week."

Plinio Salgado and his PRP, with their ties to Brazilian Integralism and their Fascist counterparts in Europe, were dark-horse candidates in this Election. Despite the odds, however, and despite concerted character-smearing by the Opposition, Salgado has become a viable electoral candidate – and he has won. \n\nWhile the PRP is far from dominating Brazilian politics due to the established political order of Vargas and his supporters, this electoral victory has created a sense of threat for the PSD and PTB, with the possibility of radicalism coming closer to home."

His involvement in Vargas' key reforms has created a loyal following among Vargas supporters, but the turmoil of the President's resignation forced Kubitschek onto a new road.\n\n Kubitschek has consolidated and expanded his base with promises of reform, bringing PTB and PSB supporters into his electoral bloc. Kubitschek's victory will be both old and new: an extension of Vargas' old government and populism, but with these tactics applied to rebuilding Brazilian healthcare, economics and infrastructure from the ground up."

Inspired by the old Vargas, Jango has sworn to follow through on his sweeping promises of social reform, focusing on the working man."

##Electoral System
BRA_electoral_system:0 "The Fourth Brazilian Republic"
BRA_electoral_system_desc:0 "The Fourth Republic was established in 1949 after a serious fallout of relations between former dictator Gétulio Vargas and Eurico Gaspar Dutra, field marshal of the Brazilian Armed Forces. Vargas' Estado Novo had begun to breakdown after a series of liberal protests destabilizing the regions of Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre, inspired by the liberal democracy of the United States, a close partner to Vargas' regime.\n\nWhile the liberal reforms implemented after these ‘Yellow Fall' helped establish the groundworks of the Fourth Republic, it would eventually lead to Dutra ending the Vargas government and the Estado Novo in 1949. José Linhares would become the first Brazilian president (1949-1951), promising a return of free elections and democracy to Brazil. His policies, influenced by an elderly Dutra pulling the strings with the armed forces, would cause the later economic position Brazil finds itself in in 1952. Vargas would return to the Brazilian political landscape in 1952 after Linhares' term ended prematurely due to severe corruption scandals and a hostile relationship with the pro-German military faction."
