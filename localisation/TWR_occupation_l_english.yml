twrgeroccupation.1.t:0 "Occupation of Great Britain"
twrgeroccupation.1.d:0 "Through our conquest, the dream of Operation Sealion has been accomplished. The German flag flies proudly atop Buckingham Palace, and Britain lies firmly under German control. In order to adminster the island effectively, several plans have been suggested. Some elements of the Reich believe that direct occupation for the time being would be the best option, since it allows Germany to extract British resources and monitor unrest closely. However, we can also choose to enact the plans left in place for the aftermath of Operation Sealion - divide Great Britain into Scotland, Wales and England, with all the new nations being strongly tied to Germany, while a part of England can be under direct German control. Alternatively, we can choose to allow the formation of a new British state, a direct contender for the title of the real government of Britain."
twrgeroccupation.1.a:0 "Direct rule from Germania!"
twrgeroccupation.1.b:0 "Enact the Division Plan."
twrgeroccupation.1.c:0 "Form the new British Government."
twrgeroccupation.2.t:0 "Question of Northern Ireland"
twrgeroccupation.2.d:0 "The British territory of Northern Ireland has been occupied by German forces. The local Irish Republican Army aided the occupation and, in turn, they demanded that the region to be united with the Republic of Ireland. Officers of Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe are calling for a direct military occupation, while political wings of the government suggest that handing Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland would be a wise move to gain political favour from Ireland, which might result in Germany gaining a new ally."
twrgeroccupation.2.a:0 "Ulster will be under German control."
twrgeroccupation.2.b:0 "Transfer the six counties to the Republic."
twrgeroccupation.2.c:0 "Actually, another idea..."
twrgeroccupation.2001.t:0 "Question of the High Commissioner"
twrgeroccupation.2001.d:0 "Shortly after the formation of the Ulster Protectorate, the position of High Commissioner was held by a German. However, the Reich has allowed some reforms to be made when Germany formed the Protectorate Government with some local leaders. Due to the nature of Irish Nationalism, they have been disallowed from taking any high governmental roles in the Protectorate. The candidates of this position have all been approved by the German Reich, though there's only one local Unionist candidate, and the other one is the current German Commissioner directly appointed by the Reich."
twrgeroccupation.2001.a:0 "Get the Unionist in!"
twrgeroccupation.2001.b:0 "Keep the German!"
twrgeroccupation.3.t:0 "Irish Unification"
twrgeroccupation.3.d:0 "German officials has invited our delegates to Belfast, willing to discuss the terms of Northern Ireland's return to the Republic of Ireland. Shockingly, the Germans have appeared to be overwhelmingly generous, willing to grant us the ownership of Ulster without any significant drawbacks. We have gratefully accepted their offers, and this has hopefully ushered Germany and Ireland into a new period of fruitful partnership."
twrgeroccupation.3.a:0 "26 + 6 = 1!"
twrgeroccupation.3001.t:0 "The Belfast Award"
twrgeroccupation.3001.d:0 "Playing the role of \"Peacekeeper\", Nazi Germany has once again decided to hand out territory to other European countries. This time, following the examples laid by the Vienna Awards, this ceremony was held in Belfast, between Germany and the Republic of Ireland. Delegates from both sides were friendly towards each other, with the Irish displaying great joy at Germany's decision to grant Ireland her long desired unification.\n\nAfter the signing of various treaties and a brief exchange of gratitude, the ceremony ended with Germany and Ireland declaring a new period of friendship, and thus marking the end of the Belfast Award."
twrgeroccupation.3001.a:0 "Our Irish ally deserved this!"
twrgeroccupation.3001.b:0 "Interesting."
twrgeroccupation.3001.c:0 "Ireland is whole again!"
twrgeroccupation.3001.brit:0 "This is illegal!"
twrgeroccupation.4.t:0 "Formation of the Civil Government"
twrgeroccupation.4.d:0 "After rounds of political dealings with the Conservatives, National Labours, Liberals, Unionists and other political leaders that were unable or were unwilling to flee Britain, a Coalition Civil Government with permitted Opposition has been proclaimed, taking over the Occupation Government's duties and ensuring the policy of "British Land, British Leaders", with Ronald Nall-Cain being appointed the Transitional Prime Minister until the next general election."
twrgeroccupation.4.a:0 "Britain Prevails!"
twrgeroccupation.5.t:0 "The Black Book"
twrgeroccupation.5.d:0 "The Sonderfahndungsliste G.B. (also known as the Black Book) is a list drafted by the Reich Main Security Office, listing all of the potential oppositions to Nazism within Britain. A comprehensive listing organisations such as the British Freemasonries, local trade unions, Zionist groups to political parties alongside a long list of names, this guide has now been issued to German authorities in Britain.\n\nAll collaborationist law enforcement agencies have been ordered to follow this list and persecute each and everyone of the names on the list alphabetically."
twrgeroccupation.5.a:0 "We have to..."
twrgeroccupation.6.t:0 "Occupation of Iceland"
twrgeroccupation.6.d:0 "The stepping stone from Europe to North America, Iceland lies in the North Atlantic, an important tactical location for control over shipping and transatlantic routes. With Iceland secured, two options are suggested.\n\nThe first is controlling Iceland directly from Germania, treating it as an extension of the Reich without any form of local civilian administration. The other option is to transform Iceland into a Protectorate, a loyal subject of the Reich under the same Nordic, Germanic bloodline."
twrgeroccupation.6.a:0 "Form the Icelandic Authority!"
twrgeroccupation.6.b:0 "Direct rule from Germania!"
twrgeroccupation.7.t:0 "Occupation of Canada"
twrgeroccupation.7.d:0 "Canada has fallen, and the question of Canada's new administration has been raised. With a nation that is this large in physical size, three options are offered by the Reich Ministry of Liberation.\n\nThe first is the 'Two-States Solution', dividing Canada between French-speaking Quebec and the English-speaking remainder of Canada, ensuring nationalism and loyalty with divide and rule. Second, the One-State Solution, by grouping the English and French speaking Canadians into a coalition collaborationist government, creating a regional ally for Germany. And lastly, Germany could directly occupy the lands in the name of safekeeping, but this will surely will be the most resisted among the Canadian population."
twrgeroccupation.7.a:0 "Quebec and Canada!"
twrgeroccupation.7.b:0 "There's only one Canada!"
twrgeroccupation.7.c:0 "Ottawa? More like Germania!"
twrgeroccupation.8.t:0 "Forming Quebec"
twrgeroccupation.8.d:0 "After the hunt for a suitable government, Quebecois nationalists have reached out and contacted German authorities, agreeing provide Germany with the needed support. Not long after the agreement, Quebec has officially declared itself as a nation, part of the Greater German Reich and all of it's loyal subjects."
twrgeroccupation.8.a:0 "Long live Quebec!"
twrgeroccupation.9.t:0 "Declaration of Canada"
twrgeroccupation.9.d:0 "The Civil Government of Canada has been formed, with a handpicked cabinet that is loyal to Germany. Canada has been allowed limited democracy and self determination, with the only condition being Canada's unquestionable partnership with Germany. While the civil government is formed, it's expected that the new regime will face major resistance across the vast expanse of the nation."
twrgeroccupation.9.a:0 "O Canada!"
twrgeroccupation.10.t:0 "Anglo-French Coalition Gridlock"
twrgeroccupation.10.d:0 "While attempting to form a Unity Government between the English and French speaking populations of Canada, both sides are facing major disagreements that are blocking any progress. However, German advisors have enforced Germania's will, and pressured both sides into an agreement towards a single, united Canada under Germany."
twrgeroccupation.10.a:0 "If they don't want to...force them."
twrgeroccupation.11.t:0 "Formation of United Canada"
twrgeroccupation.11.d:0 "The Unity Government of Canada has been formed, with a handpicked Anglo-French cabinet that is loyal to Germany. Canada has been allowed limited democracy and self determination, with the only condition being Canada's unquestionable partnership with Germany. While the civil government is formed, it's expected that the new regime will face major resistance across the vast expanse of the nation."
twrgeroccupation.11.a:0 "O Canada!"
twrgeroccupation.12.t:0 "Liberation of America"
twrgeroccupation.12.d:0 "With the vast United States of America defeated and driven off the mainland, the American Question needs answering. Ministers have raised concerns about America being an uncontrollable nation with armed thugs behind every street corner and a population much greater than the Reich at home, and suggest it might be wise for the Reich to alleviate the burden of occupation and hand them to a relatively free, autonomus partner. \n\nThe Liberation Plan aims to form a new, nominally democratic United States Government, to be one of the few almost equal partners for the Greater Reich within its sphere, given large amount of autonomy in exchange for loyalty and support. While not ideal, this is the only solution to the American Question."
twrgeroccupation.12.a:0 "Let those rebel scum come!"
twrgeroccupation.12.b:0 "Liberate America!"
twrgeroccupation.13.t:0 "Establishing the New Order"
twrgeroccupation.13.d:0 "Massive riots and even insurgency have been reported all over America. While the formation of a Autonomus Government is progressing, the resistance of the American people is hindering the restructuring of the nation, with the only solution being the mass arrest and possible termination of major known and suspected dissident leaders all across the country."
twrgeroccupation.13.a:0 "No-one can stop progress!"
twrgeroccupation.14.t:0 "Coalition Government Appointed"
twrgeroccupation.14.d:0 "After some time, some hopeful American politicians representing their respective parties, being the Democrats or Republicans, have offered and voiced their willingness to collaborate with the Reich. With a sizeable number of relatively esteemed and well-known politicians, the next Government of the United States has been founded. From now on, it is only a matter of time before the rise of a new United States of America as an ally of Germany."
twrgeroccupation.14.a:0 "Good, good..."
twrgeroccupation.15.t:0 "Liberation of America"
twrgeroccupation.15.d:0 "Hours ago, in a public radio address, Appointed President Murray has declared the Liberation of the United States of America in a speech. Stating that America is grateful to Germany for liberation from the Communists and Jewish schemers who had, until now, corrupted the United States to its core. With the special status of these new United States of America, they are in practice not a subject of the German Reich, but with huge support via resources, industry and trade, this is certainly still a favourable deal for Germany."
twrgeroccupation.15.a:0 "Glory, Glory!"
twrgeroccupation.16.t:0 "Her Majesty's Retreat"
twrgeroccupation.16.d:0 "When the Germans landed on the British Isles, the British stood firm against the invasion. But secretly, the government enacted their emergency plan for relocation. A day before the Home Isles' formal surrender, the government arranged a secretive evacuation of the cabinet and the royal family. Flying from the Faroe Islands to Canada, the exiled government made a dangerous flight across the Arctic, the government landed safely in Newfoundland.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II was greeted by the Canadian Prime Minister, but this unannounced arrival meant that journalists and citizens weren’t present to greet Her Majesty. The news was revealed after a nationwide broadcast in Ottawa where the Queen spoke directly to the people of Canada, proclaiming that the loss of the Britain will not be the end, and that the British Empire and the Commonwealth will fight on as one united body against the forces of evil."
twrgeroccupation.16.a:0 "Scheisse!"
twrgeroccupation.16.b:0 "That's...expected."
twrgeroccupation.16.c:0 "Britannia stands!"
twrgeroccupation.17.t:0 "Fall of the Home Isles"
twrgeroccupation.17.d:0 "With the Germans effectively defeating the British Forces on the Home Isles, the last remnants of British resistance collapsed when the British Government abandoned the mainland and handed full control to the local forces. Under this rump government, the Home Isles resisted for weeks before surrendering to the Germans.\n\nThe surrender ceremony was held in the bombed city of London, and these commanders were forced to surrender under the name of the 'British Government', to simulate the fact that Britain has officially surrendered. But in reality, the British Government did not respond to such demands of capitulation and outright ignored the Germans when they offered a conditional peace. Nonetheless, the guns fell silent on the British Isles, at least for now."
twrgeroccupation.17.a:0 "Großbritannien is ours!"
twrgeroccupation.17.b:0 "A disaster for the West."
twrgeroccupation.17.c:0 "Britain shall return!"
twrgeroccupation.18.t:0 "A Nation in Exile"
twrgeroccupation.18.d:0 "Shortly after our government's relocation, Queen Elizabeth II has declared the current situation as an utmost state of national emergency. With one command, the democratically elected government has been temporarily disbanded in favour of a military government. Louis Mountbatten has been appointed to the position of Provisional Prime Minister-General, assigned with the task of stabilising the remaining British territories and liberating the Home Isles in the shortest timeframe if possible."
twrgeroccupation.18.a:0 "Desperate times."
twrgeroccupation.19.t:0 "To Fight Another Day"
twrgeroccupation.19.d:0 "With German troops driving our forces out of the mainland, the unthinkable has happened - the United States of America is now under occupation by a foriegn power. Shortly before our forces in the mainland capitulated, the government and parts of the military retreated to the safety of Hawaii. And on these islands, America must stand united under a firm grip.\n\nTo preserve our liberty and freedom, the government has decided to invite General Williston B. Palmer as the emergency minister to assume control over the Federal Government. The United States of America might've fallen, but we will fight on for another day."
twrgeroccupation.19.a:0 "We will be back!"
twrgeroccupation.20.t:0 "Fall of North America"
twrgeroccupation.20.d:0 "A seemingly impossible task has been accomplished by the German Reich. Both Canada and the United States of America have fallen under the might of Germany, and their respective governments have promised to fight on until the day of liberation.\n\nHowever, due to the fact that both Canada and America have a sizable gun owning population spread across a vast expanse of territory, the resistance in these regions are fierce. Large scale rebellions are expected to occur in the near future, where Germany's control might face serious challenges."
twrgeroccupation.20.a:0 "Hurra! Hurra! Hurra!"
twrgeroccupation.20.b:0 "This is insane!"
twrgeroccupation.20.c:0 "Fight on!"
twrgeroccupation.21.t:0 "Her Majesty Arrives in Australia"
twrgeroccupation.21.d:0 "Despite the British Government's previous relocation to Canada, shockingly, even this refuge has become a target of German occupation.\n\nDeparting from North America a few days in advance before the occupation, the monarchy and Her Majesty's Government departed for Australia and New Zealand. After fays of exhausting flights and a minor stop in Hawaii, the British Government landed safely on Fiji, where the government was shipped to Australia. While this turn of events have been devastating for national morale, the Queen was seen smiling when citizens or journalists are present."
twrgeroccupation.21.a:0 "They are like cockroaches, unkillable!"
twrgeroccupation.21.b:0 "Oddly admirable."
twrgeroccupation.21.c:0 "God Save the Queen!"
twrgeroccupation.22.t:0 "The National Emergency of [GetYear]"
twrgeroccupation.22.d:0 "The Emergency of [GetYear] was declared shortly after the fall of North America. Since then, Australia's status has taken a great leap from member to the sole survivor of the Toronto Accord. Harbouring multiple exile governments, Australia's current task is to uphold the torch of freedom and democracy for the Western civilization.\n\nAnd with this pretext, the Parliament is seeking the expansion of Australian conscription to be used for defensive measures. However, this goal has an interesting twist, it advocated for the act of uniting both Australia and New Zealand into a temporary confederation of nations, in order to handle military situations with greater efficiency."
twrgeroccupation.22.a:0 "The proposal passes, but no unification."
twrgeroccupation.22.b:0 "The proposal passes!"
twrgeroccupation.22.c:0 "We do not need this."
twrgeroccupation.23.t:0 "Australia Seeks Unification"
twrgeroccupation.23.d:0 "While New Zealand enjoyed a long and fruitful period of independence from Australia, times have changed since then. The Toronto Accord is in grave danger, and Australia argues that it is desperate times like this that New Zealand and Australia must stand together in a greater union against the evils of expansionism.\n\nWhile we value our sovereignty, the noble task of fighting for freedom and preserving national security by depending on Australia is also important for our people's survival."
twrgeroccupation.23.a:0 "Allow the unification."
twrgeroccupation.23.b:0 "We will manage on our own."
twrgeroccupation.24.t:0 "New Zealand Agrees"
twrgeroccupation.24.d:0 "Persuaded by current conditions, New Zealand has agreed to a unification. Under this act, New Zealand will retain great autonomy, but national defence shall be handled jointly under a Australian-New Zealander Joint Command. With New Zealand directly a part of us, this would improve our effectiveness in handling any emergency."
twrgeroccupation.24.a:0 "Hoist the flag of Australasia!"
twrgeroccupation.25.t:0 "New Zealand Refuses"
twrgeroccupation.25.d:0 "Blinded by nationalism and ideals of national sovereignty, New Zealand has refused any attempts to create a Commonwealth of Australasia, claiming that the current state of affairs does not require such drastic actions which would destroy New Zealand's nationhood so suddenly."
twrgeroccupation.25.a:0 "Bugger..."
twrgeroccupation.26.t:0 "The Commonwealth of Australasia"
twrgeroccupation.26.d:0 "With recent geopolitical shifts, the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand formally reformed themselves into one greater political entity - the Commonwealth of Australasia.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Australasia have many problems that it must resolve before becoming a functional and stable confederation of two nations. In a radio address, Prime Minister [AST.GetLeader] urges New Zealand and Australian nationalists to look past the concept of individual national pride and take pride in their new identity of 'Australasian' instead of New Zealander or Australian."
twrgeroccupation.26.a:0 "Australasia rises!"
twrgeroccupation.26.b:0 "Interesting..."
twrgeroccupation.27.t:0 "Occupation of Mainland France"
twrgeroccupation.27.d:0 "The dust has settled, and majority of the hostile forces in France have been disarmed, the flag of the Greater German Reich is flying proudly in the towns of France.\n\nWith France finally pacified by German might, the future of France will now be decided by Germans. While thousands of Germans are now celebrating this great triumph, groups of ministers have gathered in Vichy, the provisional capital of Occupied France drafting a solution to the French nation.\n\nWhile dozens of plans have surfaced, there are two prominent plans to settle the French question. While one group is advocating for a united France, the other group seeks to utilize Breton Nationalists as means to divide and administrate the French nation."
twrgeroccupation.27.ab:0 "France will remain united!"
twrgeroccupation.27.ba:0 "Divide and conquer!"
twrgeroccupation.27.b:0 "Direct occupation!"
twrgeroccupation.28.t:0 "Question of the French Administration"
twrgeroccupation.28.d:0 "The Occupation Authority of France has managed to stabilise German leadership in France. While the local collaborators are calling for a second French regime, some factions within the NSDAP are calling for a Reichskommissariat-style government to be installed within France."
twrgeroccupation.28.a:0 "Appoint a French collaborator."
twrgeroccupation.28.b:0 "Maintain the Transitional Government."
twrgeroccupation.29.t:0 "The Border Question"
twrgeroccupation.29.d:0 "The boundaries of the French administration must be determined by the Germanic government. While we can restore the old Vichy Regime boundaries, we can also ensure the unity of France by only demanding minor concessions on the border or take nothing at all."
twrgeroccupation.29.a:0 "The Vichy borders!"
twrgeroccupation.29.b:0 "Take border provinces."
twrgeroccupation.29.c:0 "Take nothing."
twrgeroccupation.30.t:0 "Declaration of the Second State"
twrgeroccupation.30.d:0 "Thanks to our benefactors in Germania, they have generously allowed the French people to administrate themselves under a German appointed French Prime Minister. Prime Minister Edgar Puaud, a French veteran within the French Volunteers has maintained fairly good ties with the Germans, managing to secure the position of Prime Minister for the new, free, Second French State."

twrgeroccupation.31.b:0 "Set up the Iberian Occupation."
twrgeroccupation.32.t:0 "Nordic Question"
twrgeroccupation.32.d:0 "In the future, Nordic will certainly become an integral part of the Greater Reich. The Ministry of Occupation has drafted a special project in case of a total Nordic Occupation.\n\nThe Ministry suggests that, different Nordic countries should be put together into one administration with the name of 'Nordeuropa', set with the task of unifying the Nordic people with the sole goal of guiding them towards the embrance of Aryanism. While this plan is expecting an easier and more centralised way of governance, the effectiveness of this body might be limited."
twrgeroccupation.32.a:0 "Deny this plan."
twrgeroccupation.32.b:0 "We will enact this plan!"
twrgeroccupation.33.t:0 "The Swedish Question"
twrgeroccupation.33.d:0 "With Sweden being utterly defeated by our superior forces, the question of Swedish occupation comes to mind. While we can handle the Swedish people with a direct occupation, a tactic of indirect rule might also be more effective as a way to control the masses."
twrgeroccupation.33.a:0 "Direct rule!"
twrgeroccupation.33.b:0 "A puppet Sweden!"
twrgeroccupation.33.c:0 "Enact the Nordic Project!"
twrgeroccupation.33.e:0 "Transfer control to the Norwegians!"
twrgeroccupation.34.t:0 "The Fall of Finland"
twrgeroccupation.34.d:0 "Once upon a time, Finland used to be a faithful ally of the Greater German Reich. But with one way or another, the once victorious nation of Finland has been defeated and subjecated to foriegn rule once again. The occupational authority has proposed a few ways to administrate Occupied Finland with greater efficiency, including the option of an indirect rule puppet regime or direct rule from Germania."

twrgeroccupation.35.b:0 "Enact the Nordic Project!"
twrgeroccupation.36.t:0 "The Italian Question"
twrgeroccupation.36.d:0 "The decadent Italians have been defeated by our might. With the Italian mainland firmly within our grip, the question of occupation policies has surfaced.\n\nThere are two viable options in regards to the Italian occupation, first is maintaining the current direct occupation, while the second one is to establish a transitional regime to determine Italy's fate."
twrgeroccupation.36.a:0 "Direct rule!"
twrgeroccupation.36.b:0 "Take our rightful land then leave the rest!"
twrgeroccupation.37.t:0 "Heia Safari!"
twrgeroccupation.37.d:0 "Our brave troopers have occupied a chunk of Africa. It is the Aryan's burden to educate these natives, and show them the light of National Socialism. However, in order to prepare for this great effort, we must first establish our initial policy on the African occupation. While we can maintain our direct occupation of Africa for tactical purposes, we can allow the military to temporarily oversee our operations in Africa, which means forming a grand military government that has the potential to engulf all of Africa."
twrgeroccupation.37.a:0 "Direct occupation!"
twrgeroccupation.37.b:0 "Heia Safari!"
twrgeroccupation.361.t:0 "Italian Home Rule"
twrgeroccupation.361.d:0 "As part of the operation, our German overlords have generously allowed us home rule, giving us the permission to have Italians manage Italy. This decision of home rule shall stay as long as Italy is willing to cooperate with her benefactors to the fullest, and if Italy were to violate these conditions, Germany reserves the right to intervene at any moment.\n\nWith these terms discussed, the Partito Socialista Nazionale Italiano, a newly created branch of the old Fascists has been appointed as the ruling party, with Alessandro Pavolini as the first Prime Minister of the Social Republic of Italy."

twrgeroccupation.7777.t:0 "The Second German-Soviet War"
twrgeroccupation.7777.d:0 "As part of Germania's ideological goal, the German leadership has once again declared war on the Soviets, citing security threats along the quasi-borders as reasons of this invasion. On top of this, Germania has exclaimed that \"The evil Bolsheviks shall perish for the safety of humanity\", seemingly ready to finish what their many before them have failed in the past - fully conquer the Russian behemoth.\n\nRumours of a possible United Front is circulating, but the Germans are unhinged by the prospect of another long, dreadful logistcal war in the cold trenches of Siberia. Will the Germans be able to finish what Hitler has failed to accomplish?"

twrgeroccupation.7777.b:0 "Back at it again."
twrgeroccupation.7777.c:0 "Defend our Motherland!"
twrgeroccupation.38.t:0 "End of the German-Soviet War"
twrgeroccupation.38.d:0 "Years ago, Germany attempted to eliminate the Soviet Union, but ultimately failed to fully accomplish this task due to the sheer size of the Union. However, with this second attempt, the current German administration has managed to finish what Napoleon and Hitler have failed to do - Germany has finally pacified the Russian bear.\n\nAs celebration occured all across the German realm, rest of the world is shocked by this achievement. Despite the facade that the war has seemed to be done and dealt with, a new wave of resistance fighters will constantly contest the German rule, pushing the occupied territory into a state of perpetual conflict."
twrgeroccupation.38.a:0 "The Aryans are victorious!"
twrgeroccupation.38.b:0 "Concerning news."
twrgeroccupation.39.t:0 "Future of the German-Soviet War"
twrgeroccupation.39.d:0 "We have lost the public favour in this conflict, no amount of propaganda can fix this situation. If we allow this situation to carry on, the Nazi administration might be in great jeopardy with the emergence of more vocal oppositions.\n\nWe can either cut our losses and retreat to the Pre-Second German-Soviet War border in Moskowien, or we can try to continue this conflict through thick and thin."
twrgeroccupation.39.a:0 "Retreat!"
twrgeroccupation.39.b:0 "We must carry on!"
twrgeroccupation.39.c:0 "We must arrange a peace deal."
twrgeroccupation.40.t:0 "German Offer"

twrgeroccupation.44.t:0 "The Wild East"
twrgeroccupation.44.d:0 "In the lands past the Urals, the territories are considered to be dangerous.

twrgeroccupation.44.a:0 "Direct rule!"
twrgeroccupation.44.b:0 "Establish a new Reichskommissariat!"
twrgeroccupation.45.t:0 "The Turkestan Question"
twrgeroccupation.45.d:0 "The troubled lands of Turkestan are now under our occupation. While Reichskommissariat Turkestan was a rejected idea under the Hitler administration, this plan has been revived due to the fact that the Aryans have reached new heights by stretching themselves beyond former expectations. The concept of Reichskommissariat Turkestan is now more relevant than ever, perhaps these allies should be given a chance of greatness under our guidance?"
twrgeroccupation.45.a:0 "Direct control!"
twrgeroccupation.45.b:0 "To Turkestan!"
twrgeroccupation.46.t:0 "The Question of Central Siberia"
twrgeroccupation.46.d:0 "The various amount of Russian warlords in the middle of Russia have been defeated by our mighty force. However, this vast amount of land brings up the opportunity of establishing a Russian reserve entity in the middle of nowhere, under firm German influence, but of coursem this is just a political plan that might bring its own benefits."

But, Dr.Goebbels is not planning to share his mercy with the Holy See, his agenda against the Catholic Church is firmer than ever, and the fall of the Vatican City has further hardened this belief, viewing the Catholic Church as cowardly weaklings that seek to corrupt the minds of Aryan children.\n\nSoon after Goebbels' orders reached the forces in Rome, a battalion of elite troops entered the city state, destroying the Swiss Guards despite their heroic last stand. Almost all members of the Vatican staff and even the Pope himself were arrested by the soldiers. Vatican museums are also looted of all artifacts, the city was stripped of all priced possessions, priceless artpieces were also entirely destroyed. But most importantly, the Vatican Apostolic Archive was breached, and its content have been transported off-site.\n\nAs the operation concluded, troops were ordered to raze the city, burninig the St. Peter's in an uncontrolled fire within the confines of the Vatican City."

There are many options on what we can do with this city state, while under previous agreements laid during the early Hitler Era, our relationship with the Vatican shall be neutral, the change of affairs in the previous years meant the possibility of altering this agreement. We can either violate their independence and incorporate them into the Rome administration, or we can reform the Vatican City State under the National Socialist ideology, with a new system of government and new laws. We can accomplish this task by "suggesting" a new suitable Pope, which could serve the purpose of undermining the Catholic moral authority."

Right after this order, Nazi troops flooded the city, slaughtering the remaining Swiss Guards that took their last stand defending their liege and arresting the remaining Vatican personnel, including the Pope. Priceless artifacts from the various museums were also confiscated or destroyed, with documents within the Vatican Apostolic Archive looted then shipped off to an unknown location. Afterwards, the Vatican was razed by Goebbels' personal order.\n\nInformation suggest that the Pope and his staff will be executed after a \"fair\" trial, though his current whereabouts are unknown."

While the Nazis' stance on Catholicism did not change, but they have chose to generously allow the Vatican to continue its existence with a number of adjustments, such as the appointment of a Nazi Plenipotentiary and a constitutional monarchy that greatly reduces the Pope's governmental authority. With their newfound influence, the Nazis have \"recommended\" an Anti-Communist candidate as the new Pope - Pope Gregory XVII, formerly known as Gregorio Pietro Agagianian. \n\nIn his first public statement, he criticized Bolshevism and praised the Nazi regime, exclaiming that these reforms will enrich the Papcy.
