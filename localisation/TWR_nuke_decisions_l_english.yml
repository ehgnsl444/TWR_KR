twrnukes.1.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Germania"
twrnukes.1.d:0 "The World Capital is a Capital no more: a nuclear device has been detonated above the heart of Germany in Germania's Charlottenburg district, killing hundreds of thousands as of current estimates. Witnesses reported a blinding light searing commuters and German officials into shadows on the pavement, followed by a miles-high fireball rising above the district and the collapse of thousands of city blocks.\n\nGermania's historic center is aflame despite its relative distance from the explosion, and one poignant picture of the Brandenburg Gate’s half-crumbled ruin has come to symbolize the heartbreak of the once-great city. As emergency services from the rest of Germany struggle to make their way to the many wounded, one thing is clear. The brutality of the Reich has come home at last."
twrnukes.1.a:0 "The heart of our nation, our people, bleeds."
twrnukes.1.b:0 "They will be bombed, city by city."

twrnukes.2.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Hamburg"
twrnukes.2.d:0 "In what international observers are calling the Day of Gomorrah, the German city of Hamburg has been hit by a nuclear strike centered on the historic district of Altstadt. The middle-class suburbs of the city were swept by what witnesses describe as a \"wall of fire\", and among the hundreds of thousands of casualties are hundreds wounded by the storm of sharded glass in the business district.\n\nAltstadt itself, however, has not been so lucky. The city's historic core, and the network of rivers crisscrossing it, has been razed to the ground. Witnesses report only barren earth stretching for kilometers in every direction, and in its middle a barren cliff upon which the faintest imprints of rectangular rubble can still be seen. As Hamburg burns, Germany weeps with it."
twrnukes.2.a:0 "Hammonia is bowed with sorrow today."
twrnukes.2.b:0 "Hemingway would weep at the sight."

twrnukes.3.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Dresden"
twrnukes.3.d:0 "The city once known as the Jewel Box now glows with an altogether different light. A nuclear explosion centred on the Military District, the Albertstadt, has rocked the historic heart of Saxony, and the city's once-beautiful Baroque landmarks have been seared to burnt-out shells where they have not outright collapsed. The city’s financial and commercial centre, the Neustadt, has not fared much better: fires roar through the heart of Saxony, searing bankers and paupers alike.\n\nAccusations that the staunch stronghold of Nazi ideology was politically attacked have been met by silence, as have accusations of deliberate civilian targeting. The Haufkirche and Frauenkirche smoulder, and so too do the countless cultural treasures and human lives that made Dresden a vital heart of Europe burn, their ashes rising up to Heaven like unanswered prayers."
twrnukes.3.a:0 "The perpetrators have forfeited humanity itself."
twrnukes.3.b:0 "Sow the breeze. Reap the whirlwind."

twrnukes.4.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Frankfurt"
twrnukes.4.d:0 "The famed half-timber houses of Frankfurt were once the pride of Germany, and the sight of their thatch-roofs juxtaposed against the hulking majesty of St Bartholomew's was the subject of many a postcard. Spontaneous nuclear detonations above the Altstadt have wiped this piece of history off the face of the earth: according to eyewitness reports, a large chunk of the old city has been scraped off the face of the earth with the sheer force of the fireball.\n\nFirestorms have enveloped most of the new suburbs surrounding Innenstadt, and hundreds of thousands struggle to reach medical services as the city falls apart around them. German authorities have been silent on the aftermath of the explosion, citing only Adolf Hitler’s famous maxim: \"Bomb shall be met by bomb.\""
twrnukes.4.a:0 "The old Free City has been mortally wounded."
twrnukes.4.b:0 "Their smoke rose up forever, damning God."

twrnukes.5.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Munich"
twrnukes.5.d:0 "It is a savage, tragic irony: The heart of National Socialism, which once set the world ablaze, is itself afire with the unholy power of the broken atom. Following reports of a billowing mushroom cloud above Munich's Königsplatz, electronic communications around the city have broken down and eyewitness accounts report intense firestorms characteristic of a nuclear attack.\n\nAs medical workers struggle to retrieve the remains of functionaries and schoolchildren visiting the Honor-Temples dedicated to Nazi war-heroes, Germany has already fielded accusations that the attack was made on primarily civilian targets and as an ideological statement. Perhaps the most trenchant commentary on the matter, however, is that of a doctor outside the city: \"What do the corpses care whether Hitler was right or wrong?\""
twrnukes.5.a:0 "These monsters merely prove us right in their barbarity."
twrnukes.5.b:0 "A city of savages, overcome by savagery."

twrnukes.6.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Magdeburg"
twrnukes.6.d:0 "Magdeburg was a city of magnificent Gründerzeit architecture and modern industrial development, a host to a thriving market scene and a hub of German transport networks. It is now none of those things; following a nuclear strike above the city centre, much of it has been reduced to angular scribble and shadows burnt into the pavement. The Cathedral has been nearly slagged into ruin, and nothing remains of the marketplace which once housed tens of thousands at Nöel.\n\nPictures from within the city centre have revealed indescribable horrors - people half-burnt to death, empty eye-sockets still dripping serum, on the ruined city streets. Medical authorities describe a scene of pure chaos as radiation poisoning and lack of supplies overwhelm them. The butchery, it appears, has only begun."
twrnukes.6.a:0 "The cornerstone of Germany, hacked into rubble."
twrnukes.6.b:0 "The road to victory is paved in hellfire."

twrnukes.7.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Rome"
twrnukes.7.d:0 "The heart of Europe, the capital of the Catholic faith and the City of Cities lies broken. A detonation directly above the Palazzo della Farnesina has reportedly created a massive fireball rising above the old Seven Hills, destroying historical architecture millenia in the making. Eyewitness accounts also record the immediate collapse of civil authority in the city, as healthcare systems are overwhelmed.\n\nThe attack has already triggered international outcry for its provocation of the Vatican State; the Pope has reportedly been airlifted to a safe location, but St. Peter's Basilica has joined the burning, slagged ruins of the Colosseum and the crumbled obelisks in mutual devastation. The Papacy has itself been silent, save for a brief statement praying for forgiveness on the part of the attackers."
twrnukes.7.a:0 "Sic transit gloria mundi."

twrnukes.8.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Naples"
twrnukes.8.d:0 "The Neapolitan Dream, it appears, lies dead. The thriving Southern Italian city, a city of churches and architecture stretching back to the Greco-Roman period, burns with unholy light as a fireball rises above the Piazza Del Plebiscito. Eyewitness accounts tell of whole piazzas ripped apart from the ground up, fires rising up Vomero Hill and its mighty monastic gardens set ablaze.\n\nCastles have reportedly become refuges, as the Egg Castle swarms with people fleeing the incineration of their livelihoods and homes; local charitable organizations are struggling, in the chaos, to provide for a vastly expanded list of needy and homeless. Only time will tell if this beauty in the South will ever recover its former beauty, or if it will join so much of the ancient world in total collapse."
twrnukes.8.a:0 "God turns his face away, tearful."

twrnukes.9.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Genoa"
twrnukes.9.d:0 "La Superba, as it is known to its residents, is proud no longer. Eyewitness accounts bear witness to a nuclear fireball rising above the Apennine foothills, damaging buildings, estates and priceless financial assets. The famed Bank of St. George is no more, as are the shipyards that were once the pride of the maritime hub; now there is merely ruin from hill to coast, stretching in a broad arc encompassing the city centre.\n\nAs the city burns, so too do its people. Boats are reportedly capsizing off the Ligurian territories, overloaded with refugees and evacuees, and their swollen, burnt corpses tell a story deeper and more searing than mere words could ever manage."
twrnukes.9.a:0 "St. George could not protect them."

twrnukes.10.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Palermo"
twrnukes.10.d:0 "Palermo, the heart of Sicily, is shattered today; a nuclear explosion has raised a mushroom cloud high into the sky, powered by the inferno raging directly underneath. The Palazzo Dei Normanni has survived, as have much of the historical castles that predominate this old city; alas, with the breakage of windows and the ravages of fire, their citizens have not.\n\nIn the city's many ancient cellars and tunnels, however, thousands have survived the fury, and reports suggest that charitable organizations are putting up a better fight against disease and radiation sickness than would otherwise have proven possible. Here, at least, the horror of nuclear war may yet be beaten back in time."
twrnukes.10.a:0 "Hope amidst a darkening storm."

twrnukes.11.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Florence"
twrnukes.11.d:0 "The Duomo tilts, a sick man, and its dome lies exposed to the world. Ponte Vecchio has collapsed into the river, its built-up innards vomiting burnt corpses into a boiling river. These images of horror are what is left of the burning wreck of Florence, as the heart of the Renaissance burns under a mushroom-cloud sky.\n\nThe incomparable horrors of the day leave little room for speculation: hundreds of thousands are dead, including several school delegations on a cultural tour of the city, and while the Fountain of Neptune yet stands, its half-melted visage looks upon a scene of pure devastation. Most of the city's suburbs are caught in an inferno of their own, one whose aftereffects will long outlast this day of misery."
twrnukes.11.a:0 "Dante's old home, brought into hell."

twrnukes.12.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Venice"
twrnukes.12.d:0 "The City of Islands is no more: the wave of debris and radioactive water spreading from what was once an ancient system of canals speaks to the total levelling of the city of Venice. Once a proud commercial and political centre, the City is now a place of nearly levelled buildings and broken bridges; the Italian government has decried the sheer destruction of the act as proof of utter barbarity.\n\nAs for witnesses, there are few indeed: the open nature of Venice spelled doom for its residents, and when the fire came there was no place to hide. Scattered, eyewitness accounts from immediately outside the city attest to watching citizens, half-aflame, collapse beside boiling rivers that offered no relief. If St Mark was ever watching this city, his eyes are surely blind with grief."
twrnukes.12.a:0 "A priceless treasure, boiled in its waterways."

twrnukes.13.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Washington D.C."
twrnukes.13.d:0 "The heart of the Free World burns. The great monuments of American culture - the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the Capitol Hill - have crumbled in on themselves, and survivors struggling to disentangle themselves from the ruins watch a city ablaze. Today, as a grim-faced newscaster announces, is a day of sorrow for America - and perhaps for the whole world.\n\nScattered reports come in of an evacuated Senate and Congress, and of a Presidential address from Raven Rock, but the suffering citizens of the District of Columbia face no such relief. As medical services are overwhelmed by the dead and dying, refugees wait to die by their own illness. Only one thing is certain: the tragedy of Washington will soon come for America, sooner rather than later."
twrnukes.13.a:0 "America is humbled in sorrow."
twrnukes.13.b:0 "The eagle cries out, and is silenced."

twrnukes.14.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated in New York City"
twrnukes.14.d:0 "The City That Never Sleeps has been dealt a mortal blow; the Lady Liberty lies half-tumbled across a boiling bay, and the entirety of Manhattan Island is a boiling island of half-slagged glass, steel and rubble. New York City has been destroyed from an aerial nuclear strike, targeted at the Central Business District, and hundreds of thousands have been stilled from the blast.\n\nThe Bronx is consumed by out-of-control fires caused by burning apartment buildings, and survivors tell wild horror-stories of melting eye-sockets, men fused to walls or seared to shadows, and buildings crumbling in on themselves like paper houses set alight. As the American Government condemns the senseless violence of this attack, outrage sweeps the nation, and with it a sorrow that no rebuilding will ever heal."
twrnukes.14.a:0 "Lady Liberty, what have they done to you? To us?"
twrnukes.14.b:0 "The lamp has gone out; the Golden Door is fallen."

twrnukes.15.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated in Boston"
twrnukes.15.d:0 "Boston bore witness to America's beginning; now, it appears, it shall bear witness to America's end. An airburst-style nuclear weapon has been detonated above the historic city, and the North End, City Hall and the famous Boston Port have been flattened to red-tinted dust. Refugees report nightmarish scenes of boats in the harbor struggling to pick up half-burnt men before capsizing from the weight.\n\nThe city's great political dynasties have begun efforts to funnel in aid from the rest of America, and the Kennedys are reportedly leading the charge - but as the dust settles, it is clear to all that the city of Liberty has lost something immeasurable. Time will tell if this void in America's heart will heal, or if this loss is only the first sorrow of many."
twrnukes.15.a:0 "We weep, as Revere once wept, at this horror."
twrnukes.15.b:0 "America's historic heart set afire - who next?"

twrnukes.16.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Miami"
twrnukes.16.d:0 "When the Broken Atom came for the City of Magic, there was no escape; and so the fireball rising above the Bay claimed many instantly, in a poison-wave that swept Miami Beach and its coasts, scouring them all of life. The ensuing artificial flood killed tens of thousands more in the Central Districts, including the thriving Latin-American hubs of commerce that gave the city much of its vitality.\n\nAs the city mourns and struggles to pick up its wounded, a strange unity has been found in the battering - baseball teams and organized crime gangs have put aside their differences and organized efforts to pull injured from the rubble. Even so, America weeps for its fallen, and for the city that shone too bright to last; Miami will rebuild, but its invulnerable spirit is forever lost."
twrnukes.16.a:0 "Miami is lost, and the Gateway to Florida torn asunder."
twrnukes.16.b:0 "A senseless brutality, as with all bombings."

twrnukes.17.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Detroit"
twrnukes.17.d:0 "The Steel Heart of America burns today in a senseless atrocity, its automobile factories now smoking pyres and its shimmering corporate headquarters little more than embers. As a fireball hangs above Detroit's skies, horrified Canadian authorities have promised aid to the swarms fleeing across the Ambassador Bridge's half-melted remains to safety.\n\nFor those that remain, living is scarcely better than death; the city's factories and tenements have been swept aside like child's toys, and horrifying reports of men slagged with steel parts sticking out of their corpses do not inspire confidence amongst the survivors. Healthcare services working with unions in the area have only brief words of terror, and slowly they are falling silent in the face of unimaginable stress."
twrnukes.17.a:0 "The Motor City's engines grind to a halt."
twrnukes.17.b:0 "A priceless hub of industry, dust in the wind."

twrnukes.18.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Chicago"
twrnukes.18.d:0 "The Chicago Fire has come again for the city, and this time it brings far more than simple destruction; a nuclear weapon has detonated in the skies above Chicago, a blossom of death above the Lake Michigan coast that sears all it touches. Uncontrollable fire sweeps the Chicago Loop, and its commercial buildings have fallen in on themselves; the casualties of their collapse will be a footnote to the larger tragedy of the city's inferno.\n\nThe North Side has been the gathering point for a city fleeing from itself, and vast refugee tenements have been set up outside apartment buildings while America's aid agencies tend to the wounded; but as supplies run dry and doctors and nurses begin to fall ill with invisible fevers, it is clear that Chicago's nightmare has only just begun."
twrnukes.18.a:0 "A deathly breeze sweeps the Windy City."
twrnukes.18.b:0 "If Chicago burns, no safe place remains."

twrnukes.19.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above San Francisco"
twrnukes.19.d:0 "Only fifty-odd years after its last conflagration, San Francisco is once again alight - the Bay Bridge bows at an impossible angle before the smoking ruins, and the North Beach is a hub for the Beat Generation no longer. Countless writers and artists of this magnificent Western city have already been confirmed dead or missing in the blast, and many more innocents will surely die before another week passes.\n\nThe urban areas of the West Side are already in shambles, many of them ablaze in fires that cannot be contained, and refugees stream into Oakland with the desperation of those with nothing to lose. When men next return to the Golden Gates' slagged ruins, they will behold a much-reduced city and an American icon that has had everything stripped away from it."
twrnukes.19.a:0 "Let the fog cover our beloved like a funeral gown."
twrnukes.19.b:0 "The Golden Gates can beckon no longer."

twrnukes.20.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Los Angeles"
twrnukes.20.d:0 "The City of Angels, dragged into hell - it would be poetic, if not for the sheer tragedy. A fireball rises above the Los Angeles Basin, sweeping up buildings, trees and people in the sheer force of its winds, and a firestorm to rival Lucifer's work has burned out the districts of this famous city. Long Beach lies in ruin, with twisted corpses piled atop each other on the sand in their last efforts to extinguish the fires on their bodies.\n\nHorror upon horror abounds for the survivors: Hollywood's film actors fall forever silent as radiation hits their estates, and the San Antonio Mountains are choked with refugees struggling to get away from the blaze. Tinseltown is itself aflame with the chaos, and for now, the endless magic of the Silver Screen City has faded into an endless tragedy."
twrnukes.20.a:0 "Stop the filming - I cannot bear to watch."
twrnukes.20.b:0 "The Entertainment Capital shall entertain no more."

twrnukes.21.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Perm"
twrnukes.21.d:0 "The city once named Molotov is now itself a kilometres-wide incendiary cocktail - as the former administrative capital of the Soviet Union burns, so too does the industry and commerce of its vibrant inner districts. Its Opera and Ballet Theatre, once considered the best in Russia after the burnings of Moscow and Leningrad, is now a smoking husk, as are the residential districts that fan out for miles beyond the main grounds.\n\nReports are scarce as ever from what remains of Russia, but the few reporters on the scene report scenes that could have come from the Patriotic War itself; rivers of bloodied and broken humanity flowing into the towns and villages as their capital burns. Mother Russia bleeds, and its people, as ever, bleed with it."
twrnukes.21.a:0 "Our fury shall power our vengeance for this atrocity."
twrnukes.21.b:0 "May the Factory of Russia heal from this horror."

twrnukes.22.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Gorki"
twrnukes.22.d:0 "The city of Maxim Gorky, the Socialist Realist pioneer, has had a tragedy written in the blood of its citizens - the Volga runs red-pink with the choked-up bodies of Gorki's citizens, as a hellfire sears the industrial centre with an unearthly fury. Minin and Pozharsky Square have been wiped off the face of the earth, and the Spit, that confluence of the Oda and Volga rivers, has been seared into a burning, pitted wreck.\n\nSoviet medical services, notoriously tightlipped, have relented and begged for international aid - as doctors enter the scene their reports are the stuff of nightmares: burnt-off arms and legs crumble at the touch, and melted eye-sockets twitch uncontrollably. The long horror of Russia, it appears, has opened a fresh, bitter chapter."
twrnukes.22.a:0 "Oh, Gorki, the Kremlin could not save you from this."
twrnukes.22.b:0 "If Russia could turn its pain into prose..."

twrnukes.23.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Sverdlovsk"
twrnukes.23.d:0 "The city of the Catherines has suffered a blow that no Empress of Russia can ever hope to undo; as the fireball rises above the Iset River's banks, it is accompanied by scenes of unimaginable horror for soldiers and civilians alike. As the head of the Ural Military District, Sverdlovsk has a preponderance of soldiers and officers; now, it appears, war has come to them unprepared.\n\nThe results are tragically predictable: as the Military Academy burns, so too do its residents, and local garrisons report being overwhelmed by refugee and aid requests. The skyrocketing rate of violent crime goes unnoticed in the chaos that sweeps the residential-industrial districts; the recovery of this once-beautiful city will be slow and painful, if it comes at all."
twrnukes.23.a:0 "The Romanovs have issued a last, bloody retort."
twrnukes.23.b:0 "The Gateway to Russia's East is wreathed in flame."

twrnukes.24.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Moscow"
twrnukes.24.d:0 "For the second time in two decades, Russia's old heart burns. Moscow's old scars have been torn anew in a conflagration to rival the initial fury of the German advance - the old Kremlin's half-repaired ruins have been swept away in a storm of fire and shredded debris, as have the domes of St. Basil's Cathedral.\n\nEyewitness accounts, like nightmares, bear witness to a fresh, wild spasm of human suffering. Reports of Germans and Russians strangling each other in the streets, as their skin peels off their bones, have paralyzed European and Russian authorities. May God help Moskau, for reports from overwhelmed civil and medical authorities suggest that the government simply cannot."
twrnukes.24.a:0 "Oh, Moscow. My heart weeps for your ruined beauty."
twrnukes.24.b:0 "Will fresh horrors not cease for this city?"

twrnukes.25.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Nanjing"
twrnukes.25.d:0 "Jinling, the Golden Hill City, Nanjing. Survivor of countless atrocities and sackings, and every time it has fallen, it has risen stronger. But today, as a poison mushroom rises over the capital, it brings with it a death that is silent and lasting - and the hell-winds that sweep through the capital of China's Republic promise a fate worse than death itself.\n\nThe city's countless historical architecture, with some sections stretching back to the Six Dynasties, are aflame and slagged half to rubble; so too are the Presidential Palace and the tomb of Sun Yat-Sen. Trapped in the rubble are perhaps as much as a million people, desperate, bleeding and choking blood. If China's white sun was ever ascendant, today it is shrouded in a pallor of pain and blood - no light escapes it."
twrnukes.25.a:0 "Li Bai's sorrow resounds in the ruins."
twrnukes.25.b:0 "The Republic's heart trembles."

twrnukes.26.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Beijing"
twrnukes.26.d:0 "Beijing's sorrow is often that of China's itself - as a fireball sears through the districts of the Northern Capital, the screams of its death are echoed through the nation. Tiananmen Square and the Hall of the People, seared to ash by the storm - the siheyuans of the teeming suburbs, blown apart where they do not simply vanish off the face of the earth.\n\nAs the survivors - by some counts near a million - rise from the rubble, they are confronted with sights beyond human belief: one memorable photograph that has leaked to the international press has been that of a baby surrounded by rubble, sobbing against the angular shadow of a pillar and the shadow of what was once his mother - her arms still outstretched to clasp her child."
twrnukes.26.a:0 "The old home of emperors has become a pyre."
twrnukes.26.b:0 "Beijing repeats its sundering upon foreign yokes."

twrnukes.27.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Chongqing"
twrnukes.27.d:0 "Chongqing, the City of Rivers and Mountains, resounds: not with the sound of the monsoon or of thunder but of an unearthly horror, borne from the explosion far above its surface. The former Republican Capital burns uncontrollably, with the strength and force of the explosion rebounding onto the city after being bounced off the nearby mountains - although this dense geography has absorbed some of the traumatic force, it has not been nearly so successful in protecting its levelled buildings.\n\nAs survivors flee across the Ba mountains, they report scenes of surreal carnage: endless convoys of floating corpses heaped upon the Jialing River, floating across a cityscape virtually levelled by the blast. Witnesses to old carnage, and martyrs for a new one."
twrnukes.27.a:0 "No more shall poets love its shimmering rivers of night."
twrnukes.27.b:0 "If the old Bastion burns, nowhere in China is safe."

twrnukes.28.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated in Guiyang"
twrnukes.28.d:0 "An old heart of China crumbles before the inferno today: as witnesses report a fireball expanding above the city centre of Guizhou, a city that traces its roots back to the foundation of China itself is overcome with ruin. The hurricane-force inferno has spread to neighbouring districts, destroying newly built Republican commercial zones, and there is no hope that local authorities can contain the destruction.\n\nWith the burning of the old comes the death of the new: hundreds of thousands have taken refuge in Qingyan Town's half crumbled stone walls, and there they wait as disease and famine sweeps the broken city. As for the city centre itself, not much remains: the bustling heart of Jiaxiu Pavillion is ash and dust, taking the immortal poetry within it into history."
twrnukes.28.a:0 "An impossible tragedy for an ancient city."

twrnukes.29.d:0 "The birthplace of the National Revolution has met with a brutal rebuke - as Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang burn, set alight by the atomic candle burning overhead, millions in China's industrial heart burn with it. The sprawling industrial estates of China's companies are choked with smoke, bodies and disease as toxic as the infernos outside.\n\nAs with industry, so with people. Zhongshan Avenue and a hundred others burn with nightmare-fires, the Bund and Armory are crumbled to dust and the Golden Waterway is itself a boiling soup of dead bodies and rubble: there is nowhere for the survivors to hide, and for those that cannot flee on the packed roads into the Central Plain only a slow, lingering death awaits."

twrnukes.29.b:0 "To inflict this upon China's Chicago? Inhumane!"

twrnukes.30.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above London"
twrnukes.30.d:0 "London burns, again. Death follows the fire, first in the shockwave that sweeps Central London, then in the chaos as everything, everywhere, explodes into flame. Fire-wreathed spectres stumble out of smouldering metal pyres melting into the seared tar of what used to be highways in Westminster. Behind them the arteries and the vitals of a nation that thought itself Imperial melt apart like playthings in the sun.\n\nAs they gaze across the melted steeples of Parliament, the horizon glowing from end to end in the direction of what used to be Aldersgate, the suddenly-boiling Thames choked with the debris of broken boats - the screams begin, and they go on and on and on in a nightmare liturgy. They do not, however, stop. They will not stop for quite awhile."
twrnukes.30.a:0 "Oh. Oh my God."
twrnukes.30.b:0 "A nightmare has come to Britain."

twrnukes.31.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Birmingham"
twrnukes.31.d:0 "Birmingham believed itself spared when the Armistice ended the early stages of Luftwaffe bombing on its outskirts. It was proven wrong today: the Bull Ring of Birmingham, Colmore Row and Jewelry Quarter have been razed to the ground by a single warhead far more powerful than any mere incendiary bomb. Fires rage across the wider Birmingham area, unchecked and uncontainable, and leave suburbs ravaged shells in their wake.\n\nThis is only the beginning, however, of Birmingham's sorrow. As the population clusters in surviving shelters in the south and east, refugees speak of new horrors of illness and famine spreading - and of elderly dazed by shock wandering into the fires, never to return."

twrnukes.32.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Liverpool"
twrnukes.32.d:0 "The New York of Europe is fallen by foreign hands: the Pier Head's stumps tower above a city set alight by the fireball rising into its skies. Liverpool's famed cultural and musical beats, stemming from its diverse West Indian and Commonwealth-wide expatriates, have been burned to the ground as well: the pubs of Islington and Mathews Street are one with Nineveh and Tyre, and their musicians have melted into the crowds streaming away in every direction.\n\nFor the survivors there is no help coming from the Government: medical and civil authorities have barely responded to rising panic, famine and death counts, and incidents of officials attempting to flee the blazing harborfront have become fuel for division in an already suffering Britain."
twrnukes.32.a:0 "Hell has joined Liverpool's international community."
twrnukes.32.b:0 "A disastrous cultural loss for the English nation."

twrnukes.33.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Dover!"
twrnukes.33.d:0 "The famed White Cliffs glow with a nightmare pallor today - as the fireball blossoms above the town of Dover, visitors and civilians have been swept off the Earth in a blaze of hellish fire that destroyed the town's seaside resorts and commercial ports. The Channel has caught most of the radioactive fallout, according to civil correspondents, but this has only brought a horror-tide of dying boat-crews and sea vessels into a town crippled by its own burning.\n\nAs refugees struggle with the dying and dead to claw their way to the safety of the Channel, medical authorities have reportedly resorted to dumping bodies off the coast - vast, unmarked floating patches of corpses now litter the Channel, nauseating reminders of an atrocity perpetrated on an innocent port town."
twrnukes.33.a:0 "The Key to England, broken and hollowed."
twrnukes.33.b:0 "What did the enemy have against Dover?"

twrnukes.34.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Sheffield"
twrnukes.34.d:0 "When the end comes for Sheffield, it comes in a quick, sharp burst. A mushroom cloud detonates in the middle of South Sheffield, along the Canal, in a suburb called Tinsley: this district is vaporized, as is much of South Yorkshire proper, the industrial core of Sheffield, and the city centre. There are violent firestorms and earthquakes - mothers lose sons in the inferno, lovers torn apart figuratively and literally by the winds of Hades.\n\nSurvivors encounter scenes for which Bosch would have struggled to find the words. A police officer, swaddled in bloody bandages around the face, yells at a weeping woman clutching a wizened corpse. Around them lie the bodies, bloated and half-burnt, of thousands upon thousands, unburied and rotting - the lucky ones."
twrnukes.34.a:0 "Turn off the camera. I can't bear to watch this."
twrnukes.34.b:0 "Sheffield has today become a Hell on Earth."

twrnukes.35.t:0 "Nuclear Weapon Detonated Above Glasgow"
twrnukes.35.d:0 "The Miracle on the River Clyde has come to a bloody halt: a nuclear fireball rises above the Second City of Empire, and it takes the wealth and power of the city with it. Glasgow's famed modern streets are torn to barbarity as well, smoking shells of their former selves upon which the survivors stagger to find help that will never arrive.\n\nThe rubble of the City Chambers will prove no help to the milling crowds, as will the chaos unfolding upon George Square: amidst the desperate calls for help and the cries of the dying and heavily wounded come a call for justice from a distant London. There is talk of betrayal in the city's refugee centers, betrayal that becomes ever sharper with each missed food ration - even, it is whispered, of separatism."
twrnukes.35.a:0 "Scotland's beauty and our joy - broken forever."
twrnukes.35.b:0 "A tragedy for the English stepbrother."
