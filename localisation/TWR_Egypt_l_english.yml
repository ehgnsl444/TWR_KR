twregypt.1.t:0 "Cairo Fire"
twregypt.1.d:0 "The previous day's clashes between Egyptian Police and British Forces in Ismaïlia have ended with the siege of Ismaïlia by 7,000 British troops and a fierce battle between Egyptian and British forces, leaving 71 Egyptians dead and 100 others injured. While the Egyptian Monarchy seems to be willing to comply with British demands, the people of Cairo were furious and took to the streets. Unrest resulted in a massive outbreak of fires in Cairo, specifically targetting European associated buildings.\n\nAnglo-Egyptian relations have now reached a point of peak tension."
twregypt.1.a:0 "Oh lord..."

twregypt.53.t:0 "Cairo Fire"
twregypt.53.d:0 "Recently, a battle instigated by Egyptian aggressors threatening British territory ended with British Victory. However, the people of Egypt have expressed their unreasonable discontent by burning European associated properties in Cairo. The British Government has been alerted and the British people are shocked by such uncivilized barbarism."
twregypt.53.a:0 "Issue a strong protest."

twregypt.2.t:0 "Martial Law Declared"
twregypt.2.d:0 "In an attempt to safeguard the monarchy's own wellbeing and appease the British Government, King Farouk has dismissed the current Government and ordered the Council of Ministers to declare Martial Law. The King's Palace is now heavily guarded and the military has been ordered to restore order in the cities of Egypt."
twregypt.2.a:0 "Order! Order!"

twregypt.3.t:0 "Reports of Illegal Troop Movements"
twregypt.3.d:0 "Informants in the Egyptian Army have reported strange troop movements within the military, compounded with Italian information on a suspicious group calling themselves the "Free Officers". While it's still unconfirmed information, the Monarchy is forced to stay put in case of a possible upcoming coup."
twregypt.3.a:0 "Stay put."

twregypt.4.t:0 "Free Officers Coup"
twregypt.4.d:0 "After a brief illegal radio address, the Egyptian Military has launched a coup to overthrow the monarchy under the guise of overthrowing the oppressive regime and ousting the British imperialists from Egyptian soil. While a Revolutionary Government has been set up, the true power lies in the hands of the Military. On top of that, the overthrown Monarchist Government is still at large, and the question on how the situation will unfold remains uncertain."
twregypt.4.a:0 "Egyptian drama..."

twregypt.5.t:0 "Question of the Monarchy"
twregypt.5.d:0 "Under pressure from both the Egyptian Government and the people of Egypt, King Farouk is 'advised' by his close confidants to abdicate the throne. However, Italian and British agents have notified him that the monarchy might be preserved via foreign intervention. The Italians offered King Farouk safety and a position in Egypt on the sole condition that King Farouk abdicates and allow a regency to be formed, while the British offered for King Farouk to retain his position as monarch with the condition of future reforms to benefit British interests."
twregypt.5.a:0 "The monarchy must go... for good."
twregypt.5.b:0 "Seek Italian Support."
twregypt.5.c:0 "Seek British Support."

twregypt.6.t:0 "The Regent Counter Coup"
twregypt.6.d:0 "With Italian Support and some secret dealings with many Egyptian Officers, causing some previously loyal Free Officers to defect alongside their men, the military's unity has been crippled, and the Revolutionary Council and remaining elements of the Free Officers are now outnumbered and facing a dangerous situation. After a brief but impossible fight in major urban centers of Egypt, the Revolutionary Government has escaped to Palestine. Major figures such as Nasser and Naguib are now in exile, with other supposedly Free Officer Corps supporters defecting and denouncing the two individuals. \n\nThe Regency Government reigns supreme."
twregypt.6.a:0 "Regency Victory!"

twregypt.7.t:0 "The British Counter Coup"
twregypt.7.d:0 "With British Support and some tempting deals for Free Officers defectors, support for the Revolutionary Government rapidly collapsed. After brief battles with the remaining skeleton crew of the Revolutionary Government, the revolutionaries realized how dire the situation has become and escaped to Palestine. Major figures such as Nasser and Naguib are now in exile, with other supposedly Free Officer Corp supporters defecting and denouncing the two individuals. \n\nThe Monarchy reigns supreme, and at the moment, the popular revolt seems to be a lost cause."
twregypt.7.a:0 "Farouk is pleased!"

twregypt.699.t:0 "Failed Counter Revolution"
twregypt.699.d:0 "After failing to secure foreign support, the Revolution has reached the until now untouched parts of the country, ousting the King, monarchist support and any elements of a regency government that are standing against the tide of the people. Despite the attempts to salvage the situation by the Royalty, they are now forced into exile with the Republic declared the new regime of Egypt."
twregypt.699.a:0 "We tried."

twregypt.51.t:0 "Egyptian Request"
twregypt.51.d:0 "With Egypt in turmoil, the government is now requesting the support of Italians to establish a new, Pro-Italian Government under the Regency Government. While this might be undoubtedly beneficial for the Kingdom of Italy, the cost to our coffers would be great, and there could be repercussions from powers with their own interests in the region, most notably Britain."
twregypt.51.a:0 "We are going in!"
twregypt.51.b:0 "This isn't our problem."

twregypt.52.t:0 "Egypt in Chaos"
twregypt.52.d:0 "After secret overtures to Italy were refused, the monarchist government is now seeking British intervention to defeat the Revolutionary movement. They have promised that British interests in the Suez Canal would be respected by the Monarchy, which is definitely not the case should the anti-British revolutionaries gain power. This might be an opportune moment to secure our interests, but the costs could be great, and the British people may not welcome another far-off intervention."
twregypt.52.a:0 "British influence MUST be secured!"
twregypt.52.b:0 "Who are we to intervene?"

twregypt.70.t:0 "Arrival of the Egyptian Revolutionary Government"
twregypt.70.d:0 "After the failure in overthrowing the government in Egypt, elements of the Revolutionary Government have escaped to Palestine, which we have welcomed with open arms. Palestine shall now be a base of operation for Pan-Arab ideals in Egypt and soon, the entirety of the Middle East."
twregypt.70.a:0 "Welcome, Egyptian brothers!"

EGY_western_influence_desc:0 "With the United Kingdom still stationing themselves in the Suez Canal and the Egyptian Government still heavily influenced by the British, the economy and political situation of Egypt are still under the control of Western Elites."
EGY_italian_influence:0 "Italian Influence"
EGY_italian_influence_desc:0 "The Italian backed Regent Government is cooperative and accepting towards Italian ideals, with favorable trade deals and more access to Egypt for the Italian regime. While the Italian Influence isn't as strong as the old British influence used to be, Italian-Egyptian relations certainly result in a nation leaning away from the Western powers."

EGY_discontented_population_desc:0 "The Egyptian Government has been widely unpopular with the many strict laws and oppression enforced onto the population. Unrest and riots are common, and this will surely continue if things were to carry on as usual."
