 POLITICS_ATTLEE_DESC:0 "Having resoundingly defeated a humiliated Churchill in the post-war snap election, Clement Attlee brought the Labour party to power for its first majority government in history. Attlee's government so far is most famous for building the welfare state, and other such domestic reforms, as well as a reasonably moderate foreign policy, working not to escalate the \"cold war’ with Germany, and attempting, somewhat unsuccessfully, to reform the slowly collapsing colonial system of the British Empire. Despite the attempted reforms at home and abroad, however, the 1940s have been a disaster for the United Kingdom as a whole, and the once mighty empire is seeing signs of collapse. 1952 will see a time of great change for Britain, as an especially important general election coincides with huge developments in Nazi Europe."
 POLITICS_HITLER_DESC:0 "Saviour of Germany, conqueror of Europe, destroyer of the Slavic Judeo- Bolsheviks, first Führer of the Greater German Reich, Adolf Hitler, once a relatively obscure extremist politician, came to power over a weakened Germany in 1933. Under his National Socialist government, Germany won a series of miraculous victories against the entente powers, and then fought a 5-year 'Crusade against Bolshevism', finding itself master of the European continent by 1946. Hitler now stands as the most powerful man in the world, ruling from Germania, as remaining puppets bow to his power and 'subhuman races' are crushed under his boot. With age, however, he is falling increasingly ill and and mad, and as huge fractures begin to become apparent in the Nazi New World Order, it is clear a successor will have to replace him soon."
 POLITICS_BERIA_DESC:0 "Head of the NKVD, Lavrentiy Beria served as Stalin's de facto right hand man before and a renowned state-sanctioned rapist, having a large role during Stalin's purges, and following the collapse of the USSR and the disappearance of Stalin, Mikhail Kalinin assumed the role of leader, with Beria remaining as the head of the NKVD. But in 1946, Kalinin died of natural causes, which created a power vacuum which only Beria could fill.\n\nBy 1952, he commands the remnants of the Soviet Union and the Red Army from his base in Perm, safe from German attacks due to its distance and isolation. His power, however, is not the total command Stalin enjoyed, and he faces fierce competition within the Communist Party as to who will lead to the Soviet Union through reunification and liberation of the European homelands. Noticing that the people and government officials are increasingly hostile towards Beria's rule, he has voiced his sympathy to enact radical reforms in an effort to quell any future hostility. Which, might be threatening to the Politburo and Communist Party at large."
 POLITICS_SERGEI_DESC:0 "At the time an unknown Colonel, Sergei Wojciechowsky served under Kolchak's white forces in the Russian civil war. Escaping Russia, he was involved in the Czechoslovak army from 1921 until the German occupation. At first, Wojciechowsky tried to keep a low profile as he was watched by the Gestapo, until the later stages of the Nazi-Soviet war when German authorities began more thoroughly rooting out resistance in Europe, at which point he miraculously escaped to the west via Turkey, becoming a prominent Russian emigre. Following the American expedition in the Russian Far East, he became leader of the new Russian State with its provisional capital in Vladivostok, backed by the US. A vehement anti-Nazi and anti-Communist, as well as a supporter of pan-Slavism, Wojchiechowsky is determined to reunite Russia and drive the German oppressors from Russian and Slavic lands."
 POLITICS_TRUMAN_DESC:0 "Harry Truman was not meant to be president, but inherited the post after the death of the extremely popular Franklin Roosevelt in 1945. After assuming office, he continued the war against Japan, authorising the first use of atomic bombs in warfare in history. Through the Truman Doctrine, he attempted to contain Nazi influence inside continental Europe and to secure friendly governments around the world, intervening directly and indirectly in the Middle East and Eastern Asia. Despite doubts, Truman won a surprising victory, securing reelection in 1949, and in his second term he oversaw the United States becoming an economic powerhouse unmatched by anything before. Now, however, his second term is nearing its end, and it remains to be seen who will take the lead of the world's newest superpower for the next 4 years."
 POLITICS_KHRUSHCHEV_DESC:0 "Born in Ukraine in 1894, Nikita Khrushchev joined the Bolsheviks in 1918, rising through the ranks of the party and gaining favour with Stalin. Initially supportive of Stalin's purges, through the late 1930s seeing loyal party officials being denounced, including himself, caused him to question the nature of Stalin's rule. His confidence in the Soviet government as it was, shaken by the misguided purges, was shattered by the utter failure of the Soviet forces at the hands of the invading Nazis, especially in the bloody defeat at Stalingrad where he was present. While he is still openly a loyal member of the Communist Party, he has gradually shifted his position away from the type of rule championed by Stalin, instead looking to a much more open version of socialism."
 Chiang_Kai_Shek_desc:0 "Leader of the Republic of China, victor of the Chinese Civil War and the War of National Liberaetion, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek has done many great things, from subjugating the warlords to purging the communists. He fought against the Japanese in a long, brutal war, and won, retaking Chinese land in the North yet costing him millions of men. He beat back all who have tried to challenge him. However, with every blow dealt, he becomes weaker. The Xibei Si Ma threatens to tear the fragile Republic apart, and Communists sent outside the country conspire to eventually return and take back China. As threats from all sides loom over the RoC, The Red General, victor of many wars, may not win the next one."
 POLITICS_MUSSOLINI_DESC:0 "Benito Mussolini, fascist ruler of Italy since 1922, stands as a victor of the wars, but only in name. The embarassing performance of his forces against France, Birtain and Greece left Italy increasingly the lesser partner in the Axis powers. However, Italy did gain an empire in Africa, and a sphere of influence over the Mediterranean, but at the same time economic and political instability threatens to tear apart his regime, while Berlin acts increasingly as a rival than an ally."
 POLITICS_WEYGAND_DESC:0 "Building his career serving as an officer under Foch during the First World War, Weygand became Minister for National Defence under Petain's cabinet, at first based in Vichy and later relocated back to Paris. Though he was a famous member of the military right-wing and collaborated with the Nazis at first, along with the rest of Petain's government, he became well-known as an outspoken critic of full collaboration with the Axis, which continued during and after the German-Soviet War. Upon Petain's death in 1951, Weygand had risen through the ranks far enough to seize power over the nation. A year on, his rule is young and fragile, especially as his opposition to submission under Germania has sparked many internal conflicts within the Government, accelerating the Anti-German sentiment from both within and without."
 POLITICS_BOSE_DESC:0 "A popular hero of the Indian Independence Movement to rival the late Mahatma, Subhas Chandra Bose has held a complex life and rise to power.\n\nOne of the most fervent Indian Nationalists of the INC, which he had been President of in the past and leads again today, he was originally ousted from the leadership of the Congress in 1939 due to disagreements with Gandhi about the use of violent or non-violent means to achieve independence.\n\nSoon after, he was placed under house arrest by British authorities for organising dissent, but would escape India, spending time in Afghanistan where he attempted to gain the support of the Soviet Union to resist British rule. It was here, in his exile in Afghanistan, where he is rumoured, controversially, to have also negotiated with representatives of Nazi Germany, but these negotiations broke down as the Nazis, now preparing to invade the Soviet Union, had no interest in jeopardising the delicate armistice with Britain.\n\nHe would have marginally greater luck seeking to build a pact with Japan to drive the British from India, meeting Japanese officials in 1943 after travelling through the then warring Soviet Union. However, as Japanese offensives were halted and their forces failed to gain any real position close to India, this most controversial attempt at gaining a foreign ally was also unsuccessful.\n\nAfter the surrender of Japan, Bose would return to India, still a hugely popular figure, where he played a major role in gradually building unrest.\n\nThis time, the British could not stop this unrest, and British rule collapsed, the Raj falling apart as British forces hastily withdrew after a rushed set of agreements signed with the INC and Muslim League. From then, Bose easily cemented himself as the hugely popular leader of a new independent Indian Republic ruled from Delhi.\n\nWhile in India his popularity is immense, in the west, views are mixed. His obviously controversial past of cooperation with Japan, and possibly even Germany, is a blotch on his record for western governments seeking to do business with the subcontinent's greatest power. Regardless, for now, his power seems secure, and his nationalist, pan-Indian, somewhat authoritarian version of socialism comfortably rules India with a true democratic mandate."
 Hans_Frank_DESC:0 "The leader of the Generalgouvernement, Hans Frank is one of the prime examples of a Nazi "Old Fighter". He took part in the failed Beer Hall Putsch and later became Adolf Hitler's personal legal adviser as well as the lawyer of the NSDAP. During his time as the Governor-General of Poland, he instituted a reign of terror against the civilian population and became directly involved in the infamous Generalplan Ost. Even after the direct annexation of Generalgouvernement in 1949, Hans Frank retained his powerbase within the former Polish region, making him the obvious choice for a leader of the provisionally recreated Generalgouvernment during the Civil War."
 Albert_Speer_DESC:0 "Albert Speer was born in Baden in 1905 to an upper-middle-class family. His childhood lacked warmth and was bullied by his elder siblings but nonetheless he followed his ancestor's footsteps and studied architecture, first in Mannheim, then in Munich and Berlin. In 1928 when Speer's career was starting up he married Margarete Weber, the daughter of a successful craftsman regarded as superior to Speer's family. They would eventually have six children together although Speer would grow increasingly distant with his family.\n\nSpeer's career would remain largely insignificant and he would have remained so had he not joined the Nazi Party in 1931. His career was largely stagnant due to the economic crisis and so he started actively participating in politics. With this he gained the trust of the Nazi Party and in 1933 was commissioned his first work to renovate the Party Headquarters. Hitler was impressed by this and shortly after taking power he made Speer a close confident. And after that it was only natural he became the Party's - and Germany's - chief architect. In 1937 he started drawing his plans for Germania - perhaps the most ambitious urban planning project ever devised - and in 1952 the project has made great strides but is still ongoing.\n\nBut Speer was not content to remain just an architect. No, he wanted more, he wanted to become literally an "architect", a man who supervises and rules over everything, the man who will build Germany! With the Second World War Speer became Minister of Armament and used this position to consolidate his political position. Speer soon began building support and biding his time for Hitler's death - the opportunity for him to attempt to seize power. Speer could have been content to just be the world's most renowned architect, but no, Speer must be the world's architect! \n\nSpeer's vision of Germany is impressive, grand and extraordinary. But it will be built from the blood of the slave workers and the millions of poor souls in the East. Speer has earned everything he wants, but he will not stop here..."
 Kaltenbrunner_DESC:0 "Kaltenbrunner, or ‘The Terror’, as his friends call him, has the dubious honor of being the second most physically intimidating man in the Reich. Now that Heydrich has been posted to Gotenland, Kaltenbrunner stands as the most loyal, silent and terrifyingly effective man in the SS hierarchy, and now the most recent of Germany’s leaders. Not that this should surprise anyone: Kaltenbrunner’s history reads like an abridged reader of the National Socialist movement’s dirtiest, bloodiest actions, and he was there as an approving witness even when he wasn’t knee-deep in the fight against its many, many enemies. \n\nAn Austrian lawyer by training, Kaltenbrunner joined the Party’s Linz branch in 1930 and soon slipped into its higher echelons of management. He participated in strikes against the Dolfuss government and the eventual Anschluss of Austria, building close relations with Himmler and Heydrich in the process. For his loyalty to his employers he was duly rewarded with a managerial role in the Austrian SS and a role overseeing Austria’s first concentration camp. He continued to operate in senior intelligence roles across the Austrian territories, earning him the title of Police President of Vienna (and for a brief time replacing Heydrich as head of the now defunct International Criminal Police Commission). \n\nHe was intimately involved in executing the Wannsee Conference’s conclusions across Austria - it is said his binders containing details on the Final Solution were among the most detailed ever compiled, at least until he was pressured to destroy them. Kaltenbrunner’s genial nature, total loyalty to the Party and utter lack of scruples in carrying out his orders continue to scare hardened Bureaucrats of the Reich, and while many expect him to be a loyal leader, no one truly knows what will become of Germany under his stewardship - the bloodstains under the smile are hard to ignore, no matter how bright that smile flashes."
 Ribbentrop_DESC:0 "Joseph Goebbels once wrote that Von Ribbentrop had ‘bought his name, married his money and swindled his way into office’, a sentiment shared by most at the time. It cannot be denied that the man who now possesses the highest offices of the Reich is trusted by few and hated by many, for a multitude of different reasons - but one does not have to be loved to be leader, and while many hate Von Ribbentrop no one can deny his competence.\n\nVon Ribbentrop, born to a career army officer in 1910, grew up in a constantly changing environment, as his family moved from Prussia to Switzerland and then to Montreal on business. He quickly adopted a silver tongue, a natural haughtiness and a wily ambition, all of which would serve him well in future endeavors and led him to a natural career in sales. He was instrumental in organizing the meeting with Franz Von Papen which paved the way into power for Hitler, and into a cushy position of influence for Von Ribbentrop. His natural talent for sycophancy made him despised even among the fellow-sycophants of the Nazi inner circle, and made him almost preternaturally capable at flattering and cozying with Hitler’s every whim. Foreign ventures, diplomatic meetings, buying time for rearmament while smiling giddily at the international press - Von Ribbentrop slipped his way into every aspect of German international relations, making sure to press Hitler’s agendas so hard it made the Führer look moderate by comparison.\n\nNow that Von Ribbentrop has control over the office he has worshipped for so long, many whisper that he is unused to living without an object of flattery. They would be wrong, however - Von Ribbentrop knows that Europe must change for Germany to survive, and some old plans for a greater Europe built around Germany from the war era have been dusted off in pride. The time for war has passed, but diplomacy is war conducted by other means - and von Ribbentrop is nothing if not a diplomat."
 Bormann_DESC:0 "Martin Bormann, known by many Nazi officials as the Brown Eminence, has become the main moving gear in a web of intricate German bureaucracy with him as central point. Martin Bormann joined the Nazi party in 1927 and the SS in 1937, thus marking him as a part of the Old Gaurd of the party. From his membership, Bormann worked his way to the top, showing his talent in political mind games and long-term planning. Bormann would eventually become the Reichsleiter and a confidant of Hitler, a position he would continue to exploit till the death of the old Führer for Bormann’s own benefit. His political scheming would allow Bormann to control the flow of information to Adolf Hitler, turning him into one of the most powerful figures in German politics, possibly rivaling the Führer himself in power. His control on funds also secured his popularity in the party, as bribing officials and figureheads was far from immoral in Bormann’s book. Through all of this, he has effectively curtailed the power of the highest ranking Nazis, such as Goebbels, Goering and Speer.\n\nBormann’s success would not falter with the end of the war, unlike some other officials, as his long-term bureaucratic investments and the personal investments he made in party members has ensured his base of power for the following decade. Being close to a rapidly aging Hitler, Bormann’s personal ideals would quietly influence German politics of the late 1940s. As the personal secretary of Adolf Hitler, Bormann had been a major contender as the successor after Hitler and only few officials have been foolish enough to futility resist against Bormann’s ever growing power."
 Goering_DESC:0 "Herman Wilhelm Göring has been the safest option for the German Führership ever since the death of Hitler. Göring was appointed as Hitler's successor on the 1st of September, 1939, with the invasion of Poland. Göring had been a powerful figure in the party for a long period prior to his appointment, serving Hitler in his failed Putsch in 1923 and representing Hitler during a mission to the Vatican in 1931. With Hitler’s rise to power, Göring also benefited, becoming minister without portfolio, minister of the interior for Prussia and commissioner of aviation. Göring would also play a role in the German economy with his four year plan, which would become a later factor in the Anschluss of Austria. Hitler would promote Göring later to Reichsmarschall, effectively making Göring the most powerful man in the Luftwaffe.\n\nGöring would continue to play a pivotal role in the German war effort, supplying the Luftwaffe with a steady stream of material to keep the British RAF from German territory. His Luftwaffe would also keep the Soviet air force in no position to mount a successful offensive, which would be a deciding factor for the German victory. Göring would be an important player in the eventual peace between the allied forces and Germany, though never surpassing von Ribbentrop in actual importance for the treaty. In postwar Germany, Göring’s power has carefully diminished: As the main figure of the hungry Nazi warhawks, the end of the war also brought an end to the importance of the Luftwaffe in most cases. Göring also began to exclude himself from important meetings in the party, preferring the nice European paintings he has collected throughout the war in the multitude of villas he owns across the German Reich. His extravagant taste has often been the but of many jokes, which the Iron Man has seemingly started to tolerate less and less compared to his former self."
 Ciszek_desc:0 "Walter Joseph Ciszek, a Polish-American born on November 4, 1904, in the mining town of Shenandoah, Pennsylvania. Unluckily, he was caught in the storm when he was suspected of being a spy for the Vatican. Ciszek was sent to a GULAG in Siberia, where he used his time to learn Russian and Polish. Despite being in solitary confinement for most of his time in Russia, his faith in god grew stronger than ever before. However, when law and stability collapsed due to the dire situation on the European Front, Ciszek's GULAG was abandoned by the Soviets. Ciszek, believing himself to be the servant of god, took this golden opportunity to spread his faith amongst his fellow prisoners, most of which are ethnically Polish. By 1944, his group of followers, now militiamen, have gathered enough strength and formed an influential cult, converting local villages to his twisted sense of faith. During this period, he managed to establish contact with the stranded Ex-Polish Army groups and Polish Bolsheviks in Russia, convincing a considerable amount of troops to join his rank.\n\nEver since his arrival in Krasnoyarsk, Ciszek has used his almost mystic status to become a major contender, but being in a majority Russian Orthodox region, Ciszek has developed his own brand of Syncretic beliefs. With God's will, Ciszek is confident, fearing nothing while continuing his campaign of extensive preaching."
 Drozdov_desc:0 "Nikolai Fedorovich Drozdov is a man of many talents. Born in 1862 to a family of Old Believers in Surazh County, Drozdov had the luck and privilege to receive high-end education. Drozdov served the Tsarist Army after his education, and was increasingly professional on the tactics of artillery warfare. During the Russian Civil War, Drozdov joined the Red Army voluntarily, educating Soviet soldiers on the art of artillery. But as the tide turned against the Soviet Union, and when Joseph Stalin's disappearance during the climax of a war plunged the Union into absolute chaos, Drozdov committed himself to correcting Russia and safeguarding it from total anarchy. Drozdov together with a group of Soviets that refused to follow Beria's command from Perm, formed an emergency committee, electing Drozdov as their President. During Drozdov's reign, he led his men in reconquering the Novosibirsk region from local warmongers, and declared the Republic of Novosibirsk, alongside overseeing the adaption of Novosibirsk's First Constitution.\n\nUnfortunately, with growing age, Drozdov's days on this earth are numbered, and while his dream of a peaceful, prosperous Russia was far fetched, his accomplishments on stabilizing Novosibirsk has saved thousands, and has propelled Novosibirsk's status as the strongest faction in Central Russia."
 yumashev_desc:0 "A Soviet Admiral, born on October 9, 1895, Ivan Yumashev served as the commander of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, Yumashev saw little to no action in the comforts of Soviet Far East. But, the Far East was not spared from the shockwaves from Europe, step by step, chaos swept from Moscow to Vladivostok. When Soviet Far East stayed loyal, things took a drastic turn when communication between the East and Perm was severed. The last order that Yumashev received from NKVD Director Lavrentiy Beria was an order commanding Yumashev to evacuate Far East and relocate the Pacific Fleet to Soviet Union's northern base. Yumashev gathered his fleet and personnel, obtaining as much resources as possible and set sail.\n\nBut, Yumashev never reached Perm. Instead of relocating his command to Perm, Yumashev and his crew has landed on the remote parts of Central Russia, where he discovered a number of still functional, yet disconnected GULAGs scattered around his headquarters. Yumashev was successful in reacquiring these camps under proper management, turning these camps from tools of the Soviets to a major source of profit for the 'Norilsk State'. After the formation of the Russian Republic by the Toronto Accord, Yumashev was approached by the CIA, and simultaneously trading and engaging in skirmishes with his neighbouring factions.\n\nYumashev has made himself and his close group of confidants insanely rich, but this amount of wealth has painted a giant target on his back. But for now, Yumashev rests easy in his makeshift mansion, knowing that this amount of wealth can surely buy stability, or even unify Central Russia with the aims of economic growth."
 duke_mikhail_desc:0 "Born in 1870, Mikhail Dmitriyevich Bonch-Bruyevich is a descendant to the nobility of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Bonch-Bruyevich served under the Tsarists during World War One, and later joined the Red Army during the Bolshevik rule. Surprisingly, Bonch-Bruyevich avoided Stalin's wrath during the Great Purge. The Germans' invasion was swift and brutal, and Joseph Stalin's disappearance shattered all hope within Bonch-Bruyevich. At first, Bonch-Bruyevich retreated to Perm alongside the majority of the Soviet Government, Bonch-Bruyevich plotted his escape to the lawlessness of Siberia, fearing that his life would be cut short by Stalin's insane spymaster - Lavrentiy Beria. During this time, he formed a group of military personnel whom are losing faith in the Bolshevik system. And when Central Russia erupted, Bonch-Bruyevich figured that it was the time to make his moves. With his battalion of unloyal Soviets, they sneaked away from Central Command. Weeks later, they entered Irkutsk, chanting the slogans of the Tsarists and secured the surrounding areas under Bonch-Bruyevich's reign.\n\nAfter which, Bonch-Bruyevich did the unthinkable - with 'popular demand', Bonch-Bruyevich crowned himself 'Duke', granting himself the title 'Mikhail I' and establishing the sovereign state of 'Buryatia'. Bonch-Bruyevich has turned Buryatia into his personal fiefdom, conscripting locals into his Royal Army. And ever since the Russian Republic arrived, Bonch-Bruyevich has engaged in multiple skirmishes with the Chita troops, and has showed signs of increasingly madness, with every orders given out being illogical and outright suicidal. And with it, Central Russia is in a collective state of concern, about what might this Mad Duke bring upon this troubled land."
 arsal_desc:0 "Sadri Maksudi Arsal was born on 23 July 1878 in Taşsu, Kazan. Arsal spent majority of his early days of politics on advocating for Tartar and Muslim rights within Russia. Arsal served in the Kadet Party and later became a prominent politician in the First Idel-Ural State, a nation which appeared during the Russian Civil War. However, an independent Idel-Ural State was hated by the Bolshevik forces, by which Arsal left for Turkey to start a life in exile. But, when Arsal was getting relatively comfortable about his life in Turkey as somewhat of a successful politician, the Patriotic War went horribly wrong. Joseph Stalin's disappearance during the chaos destroyed any resemblance of resistance in the Union, and when German forces reached the Idel-Ural border, a group of officials declared the formation of the Second Idel-Ural State, but they were unable to establish effective control over their borders, until a group of Abwehr agents approached Arsal, offering an escorted flight to Kazan, with the intentions of making Arsal the new president of Idel-Ural.\n\nWith German support and a well amount of political experience, Arsal was able to secure the position of President of Idel-Ural. Unlike other warlords, Arsal was a politician and an advocate, he is regarded as a popular statesman, managing to secure his independence from the two regional powers of Germany and the Soviets. Arsal has faced major oppsition from Transvolga down South and the Soviets up North, and with German support slowly fading, Arsal's successful might be cut short by external influence."
 bagramyan_desc:0 "Ivan Bagramyan, an Armenian general serving in the Russian Military since the days of Tsarist Russia, then served in the Soviet Military, but only joined the Communist Party around 1941, being a member of the 'Old Guard' during the military era. When the Germans invaded, Bagramyan served under Marshal Semyon Timoshenko in the Southern Front. However, when the chain of command broke down, Bagramyan's forces were cut off and surrounded in Yaitsk, and instead of attempting a break out, he negotiated a ceasefire with the German forces, effectively assuming control over the region under the banner of 'Transvolga'. He created the ruling body of Transvolgan Conclave, a political entity staffed by his fellow officers with himself as the head of the Conclave.\n\nHaving become the most powerful warlord in Russia, Bagramyan has been trying to take on a harder stance against his neighbours, despite the growing pressure from within his followers. Until then, Bagramyan's goal is to maintain the status quo within his Transvolga 'state', and continue to expand his influence beyond his borders."
 Logothetopoulos_DESC:0 "Konstantinos Logothetopoulos was a distinguished Greek medical doctor who became the Prime Minister of the Hellenic State, directing the Greek collaborationist government during the Axis occupation. After formal treaties were signed, the ownership of Hellenic State was transferred from German to Italian control. Since then, Logothetopoulos has remained as the Prime Minister of this fragile puppet, despite his administration's hostility towards the Italians, Logothetopoulos has accepted his position under the Italians, knowing the fact that Germans have abandoned him and his government to the Italians when the treaties were signed."
 KOCH_DESC:0 "Erich Koch makes no apologies for the many, many horrors he has inflicted upon the peoples unlucky enough to have fallen under his yoke. The Monster of Rivne, as many now call him, is more likely to laugh off claims that he bathes in the blood of Ukrainian dissidents and drinks from Polish skulls than to be angered by them – of course, he will only admit that he finds the stories boring in the presence of close friends. Koch, an Old Guard NSDAP member, first gained prominence in being assigned Gauleiter of East Prussia in 1933, where he impressed the Führer with his visionary plans for infrastructure and agriculture reform and horrified everyone else with his willingness to imprison critics as enemies of the state. Having earned Hitler’s personal trust, the path was cleared for the personal assignment of Koch to the chaotic, war-ravaged and restless land of Ukraine as Reichskommissar in 1942.\nErich possesses two key attributes central to his governance style: an almost religious dedication to the National Socialist agenda, and a willingness to expand oceans of blood to realize said agenda. Under his rule Ukraine has gutted itself, closing its own schools, razing its own fields, burning its villages and disappearing their populations off the face of the earth – where the insurgent threat appears, Koch’s SS brigades will follow and leave carnage in their wake, to encourage the others. According to the Reichskommissar’s reports this policy has been extremely successful, keeping natives fearful, uneducated and firmly under the German jackboot. Outside his office, however…\nErich Koch makes no apologies for all he has done – but the ones coming for his head do not intend to make apologies for what they will do to him either. Koch can hear them coming in his sleep, in his troubled dreams; until he has rooted the insurgent-sympathisers that are surely in his circles of friends, he will never rest easy. And when Koch is restless, Ukraine trembles."

He began his political career as district attorney, he soon gained a statewide reputation for fighting corruption within local government and many law enforcement saw him as the most intelligent and politically independent district attorney in the United States. He became Attorney General of California in 1934 and led a statewide anti-crime effort, soon be became Governor of California in 1943.\n\nWarren is well known for enacting policies similar to the New Deal to rebuild California’s economy and to capitalize on the war effort against the Japanese Empire. Warren is one of the most popular Progressive Republicans within the party and he is well known for being a critic of segregation, if he were to become President he would be seen the man willing to make this nation stand on the creed it was founded upon."
 Vladimir_Nikolajevich_Ilyin_DESC:0 "Vladimir Nikolajevich Ilyin, a philosopher, theologian, former Eurasian supporter, and most importantly, a collaborator. During the German-Soviet War, Ilyin served the Nazis by being a columnist of a Pro-Nazi Russian newspaper, this effort did landed him a more cushy life in occupied Russia.\n\nWhile he did not achieve any sense of official employment after the war, he was granted the privilege of having a normal life, in exchange he fully committed himself to National Socialism, recognizing the superiority of Aryans as the Slavic people's \"benefactor\". This ideology and willingness would land him the position of the First Chairman of the Russian Autonomous Republic."
 POLITICS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "Douglas MacArthur is the son of Arthur MacArthur, a famous American Civil War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient. His father’s legacy is what led him to pursue a military career and he soon gained a reputation as an excellent cadet while attending West Point, graduating top of the class of 1903 and serving during the Great War. He quickly rose to the rank of brigadier general and became the youngest Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army at the age of 50. He soon retired from the U.S. Army in 1937 to become a military advisor for the Filipino Government.\n\nMacArthur was recalled to active duty when the Pacific War began in full swing. He led the defence of the Philippines against Japanese forces before relocating to Australia, promising to the Filipino people that \"We shall return\", before being awarded the Medal of Honor for the islands' ultimately unsuccessful defense. MacArthur was appointed as the Supreme Allied Commander and after years of fighting in the Pacific, he fulfilled his promise. After overseeing the surrender of Imperial Japan, he looked over to the European continent and saw that the United States’ job wasn’t over yet and vowed to lead the resistance against the other threat to global liberty. With MacArthur now as President, he promises not to give an inch to any future acts of aggression that Nazis have planned."
 Heinrich_Himmler_DESC:0 "Heinrich Luitpold Himmler , the Reichsführer of the Schutzstaffel is a significant political figure within Nazi politics, the face of the Schutzstaffel, a Catholic-turned German Pagan endorser is a controversial figure. From his days as a subordinate of Ernst Röhm to becoming the Reichsführer, Himmler lived a life of immense intrigue and often orchestrated plots that ensured his position as the Reich's number two.\n\nHis plots and intrigue did not hinder his ideological beliefs, remaining a staunch believer of his personal ideals while slowly shaping the Schutzstaffel into his ideal image. This agenda of his was accelerated after the 1948 Coup, where his loyalty to the unconscious Führer was rewarded. With virtually free reign over the Schutzstaffel, Himmler continued his hardline policies on the SS, ultimately creating a devoted supporter base.\n\nNow that Himmler is in the position of power, no signs are showing that his ideologically driven politics would stop at any time soon. With immense power and what one might describe as \"borderline insanity\", the subjects of his future regime have nothing but a grim future."
 Zhdanov_desc:0 "Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov, born on 26 February 1896. Initially, Andrei Zhdanov enlisted with the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1915, and gradually climbed his way up party hierarchy. Zhdanov became a trusted member of Stalin's regime, becoming the key figure in the Great Terror and many policies, eventually becoming the 'assumed' successor-in-waiting of Joseph Stalin.\n\nHowever, his lucky career did face its troubles, from losing an ideological battle against Georgii Malenkov's "technocrats" to his biggest blunder. Near the end of the German-Soviet War, Joseph Stalin vanished during the chaos in Moscow, Zhdanov quickly scrambled to Perm, attempting to secure himself a position in Mikhail Kalinin's emergency government. Although, by that point, Zhdanov was disgraced. His connections to Stalin meant nothing to Perm.\n\nOut of pity, but mostly as a move to weaken Zhdanov's influence, Kalinin appointed Zhdanov as the Inspector-General of Krasnoyarsk, tasked to manage local resources and the numerous GULAGs. But as Zhdanov was moving to take up his new position, the Soviet control over Central Russia rapidly declined, and not long after, regions surrounding Krasnoyarsk seceded. Several GULAGs in Krasnoyarsk overthrew their prison administrations, and the situation was only controlled after the arrival of Zhdanov. Zhdanov was hailed by the local Soviets as a "Protector", later on electing him as the Chairman of the newly established Krasnoyarsk Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nTo most, Zhdanov is still a disgraced politician, a drunkard that had no qualities other than his relationship with Stalin. But, Zhdanov is a fanatical ideologue, believing in his form of Purified Communism. With a state and a revived ideology, Zhdanov's time might have yet to come."
 Willis_Cronkhite_desc:0 "Willis \"Bud\" Cronkhite was a varsity wrestler at West Point, a bold figure among his peers. Living under the motto of \"live fast, die young, and be a good-looking corpse.\", Cronkhite became a rising star in the 65th Infantry Regiment.\n\nWhen the United States launched their intervention into Soviet Far East, Cronkhite's commanded the Charlie company, 65th Infantry Regiment in Russia. According to battle reports, Cronkhite managed to score a decisive victory on the banks of Zeya.\n\nWhile the pacification campaign in the Far East largely ended with the formation and consolidation of the Russian Republic, news reached the Vladivostok HQ, reporting the chaos occuring in the Irkutsk-Buryatia region. The American Garrisons, with Washington's approval, gathered marine formations and army formations near the area to form a ragtag task force, named the United States Forces in Buryatia, issued with the order to occupy the Buryatia region. Willis Cronkhite was appointed to the position of commander as the Buryat Command, demonstrating his abilities on crushing unorganized local warlords with relatively low casualties. Afterwards, Cronkhite was also promoted as the temporary commander of Buryatia, running a pseudo-government focused on reconstructing the region while preparing for a power transfer to the Russian Republic. However, his approach on reconstructing Buryatia is especially cruel, fixated on efficiency and stability."
