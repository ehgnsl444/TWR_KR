 idea_IEA_Coffee_Business:0 "The Coffee Business"
 idea_IEA_Coffee_Business_desc:0 "Prince Amedeo's economic policy is largely centered on what he calls 'the Coffee Business' which is the planting of cash crops such as coffee and cotton. Large parcels of land (along with the population living there) have been given to British, American and Italian private companies with the exclusive right to cultivate these cash crops, with disregard to the local population.\n\nThe revenues from this business are divided between the colony, the businesses, the local African nobility and the colonists that oversee the process. The business generates enormous revenues of money and have made the colony the only profitable part of Italy, contributing to its attraction of immigrants. The 'Coffee Business' has allowed for the colony to develop the living standards for the white population, disregarding however most of the native population."

It is by far the largest Christian denomination in Ethiopia and enjoys the support of roughly 60% of the native population.\n\nEver since the Italian conquest, the Orthodox Church has been persecuted due to its affliation with the Emperor and instead Catholicism has been actively preached to the population. Due to this, most Ethiopians have come to despise the Italians for their divide and conquer attitude, leading to severe shortages in the East African Army and to many Orthodox Ethiopians joining guerrila units against the Italians."

 ###Leader Description
 AMEDEO_DI_SAVOIA_DESC:0 "Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta has served as the Viceroy of Italian East Africa, a highly prestigious title, since 1937. Few back then believed that the Prince would be able to successfully manage the colony. Yet he did. He had to battle against dangerous rebels, the Italian bureaucracy and the inherent dangers of the country, but he has managed to create what is routinely called in magazines and newspapers 'a model colony'.\n\nThe Prince is a very tall man, almost measuring two meters and is a wonderful sight for anyone to behold. But behind his stern and imposing face is an intelligent and sophisticated man. Having being educated in England he has remained a life long admirer of the British Empire, to the distaste of many in Rome, and had always sought to rule a colony in Africa.\n\nAnd so after serving with distinction in the Army and in the Air Force he became the Viceroy of Africa. Although the beginning of his rule was marred with issues he was powerful enough to defeat the various rebel forces in Ethiopia, repair the territory's finances and attract the necessary investments to develop East Africa. The Prince has ruled East Africa as his personal fief, raising armies, signing treaties with natives and dealing with businessmen, all of this without even notifying Rome. His friendship with Italo Balbo has meant that no one has been able to remove him, yet, at least.\n\n    All in all, the Prince has achieved an extraordinary feat by developing a territory once fully dependent on Rome for financing, and now being self-sustainable, but of course there was a price to pay for this, for it was built on the lives of the large Orthodox majority in Ethiopia, and despite the Viceroy's popularity amongst Europeans and Muslims, the Orthodox Ethiopians do not feel the same way..."

 twrieaintro.1.t:0 "The State of Italian East Africa"
 twrieaintro.1.d:0 "Italian East Africa is the product of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War which in 1936 resulted in the annexation of Ethiopia unto the Italian Empire. Italian East Africa was created by uniting the colonies of Eritrea and Somalia with the Ethiopian Empire. The new colony became the jewel of the Italian colonial possessions, and it seemed to confirm Mussolini's ambitions for the creation of an 'Italian Empire'. In 1940, after the armistice with the Allies, British Somaliland was integrated into East Africa, adding further to its territory.\n\n     The 1940s were turbulent for the first few years with an elaborate guerrila war being conducted by the followers of the deposed Emperor, Haile Selassie. It was only through a scortched earth tactic that the Italian forces were able to lure the Ethiopian forces into a fight and defeat them. The Second Battle of Amba Alagi, in March 1944, marked the end of the large scale guerrila war and the Emperor was exiled to Kenya.\n\n    From there on, apart from a few bombing attacks against Italian officials, the colony would remain largely peaceful, becoming a pole of attraction for thousands of Europeans searching a better future. From 1944 to 1952 over half a million Europeans arrived settling down in major cities and their surroundings. With the 'Coffee Business' of Viceroy Amedeo, the colony prospers and its revenues help the Mainland's struggling economy. And with the same revenues thousands of kilometers of roads and railway tracks have been built to develop the countryside and as always, increase profits.\n\n     But despite all this, the native Ethiopians are not enjoying any of these benefits and instead are very often forced to work for large multinational coffee companies for meagre pay, and most of them live at a subsistence level whilst the Europeans enjoy living standards exceeding many parts of Europe!\n\n     Whilst the Europeans enjoy their luxuries, the Ethiopians are already planning their revenge..."
