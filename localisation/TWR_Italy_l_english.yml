    ITA_Viva_Il_Duce_desc:0 "Our strong and unstoppable country accomplished many great achievements when our brave leader, Benito Mussolini proudly took upon him the responsibility for our future 30 years ago. Our previous leaders were weak, subjects to foreign powers and interests, but with Il Duce, our nation has prospered like never before. Now with the great roots of fascism as the foundation of our great empire, we shout one thing. Viva Il Duce!"
    ITA_Domestic_Affairs:0 "Domestic Affairs"
    ITA_Domestic_Affairs_desc:0 "Italy is a divided nation. More specifically the Partito Nazionale Fascista is divided. Ciano calls for resolve and steadfastness to defend Fascism in an ever changing world. Balbo calls for reform so that fascism may survive for the next generation. A choice must be made. That choice shall change Italy, for better or for ill. "
    ITA_Rule_With_An_Iron_Fist:0 "Rule with an Iron Fist"
    ITA_Rule_With_An_Iron_Fist_desc:0 "Are we to throw away what we have built with so much blood and hardship. Balbo would throw away all that the Fascist creed adheres to. He and his clique of conspirators must be sidelined and dealt with. Credere, obbedire, combattere!  "
    ITA_Relax_The_Grip:0 "Relax the Grip"
    ITA_Relax_The_Grip_desc:0 "We may not like it, but Fascism is a faltering beast. For too long change has been resisted, and our nation has suffered for it. Ciano and his loyalists desperately cling on to outdated beliefs. These fools will lead Italy to disaster and must be pushed to the side, for nothing comes before the health and prosperity of all Italy. Vincere e vinceremo!  "
    ITA_Hunt_The_Reds:0 "Hunt the Reds"
    ITA_Hunt_The_Reds_desc:0 "Even after the defeat of their sordid overlords, the USSR, the red threat still hangs over Italy's shoulders. It is clear we have been too lax in our campaign against them. So long as they still lurk in the shadows, Italy shall never be safe. "
    ITA_Isolate_The_King:0 "Isolate the King"
    ITA_Isolate_The_King_desc:0 "Has the monarchy ever been a true ally of fascism? Whispers emerge from the Reggia Di Caserta, that the King criticizes our great Duce and the fascist cause in private. Rumours also circulate of secret meetings deep within the palace. This ancient, outdated establishment is clearly no longer of use. The King must be pushed to the side. "
    ITA_Purge_The_Fascists:0 "Purge Among the Fascists"
    ITA_Purge_The_Fascists_desc:0 "Balbo has always been a loose cannon. Too long has he and his so-called \"reformers\" dared criticize the choices which have guided Italy to its current greatness. In a month's time, no one will dare speak the name of Italo Balbo. And to think, he was a Quadrumvirate. "

    ITA_The_Father_Of_The_Nation_desc:0 "Benito Mussolini, champion of the great Italian heroes of old.

Our people shall never forget the tireless efforts of Italy's national father. "

    ITA_Strengthen_The_MVSN_desc:0 "Since the days of the March on Rome, it has been the Blackshirt which has become synonymous with fascism.

    ITA_The_One_Party_State_desc:0 "The weeds have been plucked from the ground, Italy is close to salvation. It is time for the Grand Council of Fascism to convene again. The time to name a successor has arrived. A new Duce capable of strengthening our party and nation towards a strong future. "

    ITA_Vittoria_Macellata:0 "Vittoria Macellata"
    ITA_Vittoria_Macellata_desc:0 "Our victory in the last war was not the lucrative prize we had hoped for. Our armies barely held onto our African holdings, and our invasion of Greece was a fiasco. Our situation is precarious at best. We must evaluate our relationship with the Germans. Can we trust the German Reich? For Il Duce must be second to no one. "

    ITA_Keep_The_Pact_Of_Steel_desc:0 "The new European order was formed by two great nations, the German Reich and the Italian Empire. Together this was achieved, together it shall be defended.

    ITA_Break_The_Pact_Of_Steel_desc:0 "\"You will all wind up shining the shoes of the Germans!\" Italo Balbo exclaimed upon learning of our alliance with the Reich. Though the new European order was formed by both us and the Germans, the Germans do not see us as equals. They see us as a laughing stock and as sub-human. Maybe our alliance was necessary once, maybe not. No more shall we be lap dogs to the Germans, Italy shall forge its own destiny. "
    ITA_Continue_Italianisation_In_Tyrol:0 "Continue Italianisation in Tyrol"
    ITA_Continue_Italianisation_In_Tyrol_desc:0 "If the Germans in Tyrol want to be part of Germany, they can go live in Germany. Tyrol is Italian, and shall remain so.

    ITA_Promote_Germanic_Heritage:0 "Grant Autonomy in Tyrol"
    ITA_Promote_Germanic_Heritage_desc:0 "The issue of South Tyrol has always been a thorn in Italo-German relations. The Germans consider the territory a rightful part of the Reich, and it is true that it has a strong Germanic presence. Perhaps a compromise could be found? We should give more autonomy to the region, they shall be free to choose their own regional path. Well, on paper at least. "
    ITA_Italianise_Dalmatia:0 "Italianise Dalmatia"
    ITA_Italianise_Dalmatia_desc:0 "Dalmatia, once a great insult to our fair nation. Following the Great War, Britain and France dared to give this rightful Italian territory to the fraudulent mess that was Yugoslavia. The soldiers who fell between 1915-1918 are smiling down, for Dalmatia has returned home. "
    ITA_Trust_The_King:0 "Trust the King"
    ITA_Trust_The_King_desc:0 "We have been approached by a potentially powerful ally. King Umberto II has offered his support to our faction of the Partito Nazionale Fascista. The crown carries with it the support of many conservatives, monarchists and much of the army and navy. His support is a god send. The question is however, what does he want in return? "
    ITA_Approach_The_Socialists:0 "Approach the Socialists"
    ITA_Approach_The_Socialists_desc:0 "Though it may be difficult to stomach, we must reach some kind of compromise with the socialists. We shall of course not relinquish our control to them, that would be madness. But we can perhaps placate them with an offer they cannot refuse. "
    ITA_Support_The_Monarchists:0 "Support the Monarchists"
    ITA_Support_The_Monarchists_desc:0 "The monarchy was the deciding factor in the March on Rome, saving the country from a potential civil war. Now it is time for the monarchy to save Italy once again. We shall rally support of monarchist sympathisers from all walks of life. The people shall speak as they did in 1922, and the monarchy shall once again be the flag to rally around. "
    ITA_Clerical_Fascism:0 "Clerical Fascism"
    ITA_Clerical_Fascism_desc:0 "The church remains one of the most powerful institutions in Italy. Most of our population remain Catholic. Perhaps it is time to have another meaningful discussion with the Pope. Greater cooperation between the Catholic Church and the PNF will further increase Balbo's legitimacy. "

    ITA_New_Concordat_With_The_Vatican_desc:0 "The Lateran Treaty of 1929 was a huge step for the Papacy and Italy. The Vatican was officially recognised as an independent state, while also being compensated for their territorial loss. We shall organise another meeting between the relevant parties for a new Concordat. Perhaps a lucrative deal for both parties can be reached?"
    ITA_The_Corporatist_State:0 "The Corporatist State"
    ITA_The_Corporatist_State_desc:0 "Ciano accuses us of being too liberal, and that our policies will lead to the death of Fascism. He couldn't be more wrong. We shall save Fascism.

    ITA_Look_To_The_Empire_desc:0 "The new Rome is under threat! Our Empire has always had a tenuous hold over its territories, but now things are coming to a head.

    ITA_Anarchy_In_The_Balkans:0 "Anarchy in the Balkans"
    ITA_Anarchy_In_The_Balkans_desc:0 "Unfortunate, yet not unexpected, news emerges every day from the Balkans. Every day the newspapers report that an official has been assassinated, a railway has been blown up or the army once again failed to destroy the local resistance! Our Empire in the Balkans is an Empire in name only, we must do something quickly or it may falter irreparable!"
    ITA_Send_Balbo_To_Montenegro:0 "Send Balbo to Montenegro"
    ITA_Send_Balbo_To_Montenegro_desc:0 "Italo Balbo has shown himself to be a skilled administrator, especially in his time as Governor of Libya. Though he is considered a liability and dissenter by much of the party, he may be just the man to quell the Montenegrin issue."
    ITA_Negotiate_With_The_Chieftains:0 "Negotiate with the Chieftains"
    ITA_Negotiate_With_The_Chieftains_desc:0 "The Montenegrin people remain tribal in nature. Some tribes have conformed to our rule, many more have not. These tribes are able to attack our forces and then melt into the countryside and outreaching villages. There are only so many villages we can burn down, we must reach a concrete agreement with the tribes if our presence in Montenegro is to continue."
    ITA_Integrate_Into_The_Italian_Empire:0 "Integrate into the Italian Empire"
    ITA_Integrate_Into_The_Italian_Empire_desc:0 "We did not conquer Montenegro simply to hand it back! The uprising against our early occupation showed the true intentions of the Montenegrin people to Italy and her Empire. Montenegro is a part of Italy, and it will stay that way."
    ITA_Create_The_Kingdom_Of_Montenegro:0 "Create the Kingdom of Montenegro"
    ITA_Create_The_Kingdom_Of_Montenegro_desc:0 "From the very beginning of our occupation of Montenegro our policy was clear, to create an independent Montenegrin Kingdom that would be loyal to Italy. The attrition suffered by our forces here is evidence we must hand back control to the people who live here. The King is highly supportive of this measure, as his mother was herself Montenegrin by birth."
    ITA_Stable_Montenegro:0 "Stable Montenegro"
    ITA_Stable_Montenegro_desc:0 "The garrison reports no casualties today, and no sabotage... It would seem our efforts to stabilize Montenegro have succeeded. Balbo has done what so many previous governors could not, he has stabilized Montenegro. Italy stands triumphant in this part of the Balkans, forever..."
    ITA_Militarise_Greece:0 "Greek Troubles"
    ITA_Militarise_Greece_desc:0 "The Greek people have always been tough to control. Still bitter over their conquest by Axis forces and ensuing partitioning by Italy and Bulgaria, partisan activity in Greece has always been high. Our puppet government of Greece, the Hellenic State, seems totally incapable of handling the situation. Greece is a bloodbath, something needs to change."
    ITA_Settle_On_Greece:0 "Settle on Greece"
    ITA_Settle_On_Greece_desc:0 "Greece is an integral part of our Empire, and we will not hand it back without a fight. We must ramp up our propaganda campaign promoting Italian colonisation of Greece. The new Rome shall stand triumphant!"

    ITA_Proclaim_Greek_Autonomy_desc:0 "The rebellious Greek peoples despise our occupation, and many feel that it was not us who conquered them but the German Reich... it is clear that we must loosen our grip on Greece, if our Empire is to continue its destiny of uniting the Mediterranean under our rule!"
    ITA_The_Albanian_Settlement:0 "The Albanian Settlement"
    ITA_The_Albanian_Settlement_desc:0 "The successful integration of our Albanian province is the model by which all our colonisation efforts should follow. Perhaps the Hellenic State would approve of a similar settlement for themselves, guaranteeing them some degree of independent governance. All under the watchful eye of the Empire of course."
    ITA_Greco_Italian_Ties:0 "Greco-Italian Ties"
    ITA_Greco_Italian_Ties_desc:0 "It is imperative that the Greek perception of Italy is changed, therefore a massive propaganda and social programme has been authorised. We shall show the Greek people that the Italian is not their conqueror nor their enemy. They will learn that we are their protectors and defenders against the communists who would cover Greece in gasoline and light it on fire!"
    ITA_Italianise_Greece:0 "Italianise Greece"
    ITA_Italianise_Greece_desc:0 "Italian culture is the definition of sophistication, and it is our duty to spread this culture throughout the Mediterranean! Our new Roman Empire is not for sharing with pig farmers and terrorists who have dared to murder our soldiers and citizens!"
    ITA_Return_Crete_And_Corfu:0 "Return Crete and Corfu"
    ITA_Return_Crete_And_Corfu_desc:0 "The decision to annex the islands of Corfu and Crete has been an expensive endeavor for our nation. The resistance, especially on Crete, are some of the most intense among our holdings. The cost has been deemed too great, time to hand them back to the Greeks. And we say good riddance to them."
    ITA_Insecurity_In_Africa:0 "Insecurity in Africa"
    ITA_Insecurity_In_Africa_desc:0 "Our African Empire has always been difficult to control. Resistance within North Africa still exists and Italian East Africa, still isolated by the Suez canal, has requested urgent help as native uprisings are growing out of control. The Empire must not fail! The Empire must endure!"
    ITA_Integrate_Tunis:0 "Integrate Tunis"
    ITA_Integrate_Tunis_desc:0 "Following the effective collapse of France's Empire, Italy was granted control over the territory of Tunis. A strategically valuable position for our navy, as it could in theory allow us to cut the Med in two, integration of this still relatively new territory should be of the highest priority."
    ITA_Education_In_Libya:0 "Education in Libya"
    ITA_Education_In_Libya_desc:0 "After just over 40 years of Italian rule, our colonists in our Libyan territory have flourished and prospered. And now a new generation of Italian born colonists are emerging. This new generation must be taught how our Empire and Duce brought civilisation and prosperity to a savage and desolate people. "
    ITA_Promote_Catholicism:0 "Promote Catholicism"
    ITA_Promote_Catholicism_desc:0 "Though our colonisation has seen a huge surge in Italians in North Africa, many natives remain. Most of these natives follow the Islamic faith, and the following of this faith has been largely ignored. To cement our place in these sands, the blood of Christ must run through every man and woman who resides here."

    ITA_Pacify_The_Tribes_desc:0 "Tunisia, being a still new part of our Empire, remains rife with resistance and tribal terrorism against the garrison and colonists.

    ITA_Send_Badoglio_To_Ethiopia_desc:0 "Our East African colony is far from Italy, and past the British controlled Suez Canal.

    ITA_Raise_The_Ethiopian_Crops_desc:0 "Though resistance still persists, many in Ethiopia are tired of the continuous violence and death which has engulfed their lands.

    ITA_Reinforce_Somalia_And_Eritrea_desc:0 "Eritrea and Somalia have long been within our empire, but the loathsome terrorists in Ethiopia have broken out into the territories and are plaguing our administration with havoc. Should our authority in Ethiopia collapse, these territories will make excellent staging grounds for a counter attack. Solidifying our grip on these territories should be of the utmost importance."

    ITA_Promote_Italianisation_desc:0 "We have not forgotten the Battle of Adwa and the humiliation which followed.

    ITA_Recognise_Indigenous_Rights_desc:0 "Our economy, people and are exhausted after decades of trying to pacify our colonial holdings. It is time to relent, our aim of making our Africa dominion fully Italian is unrealistic. Perhaps giving the natives some rights will placate them..."

    ITA_Establish_The_Protectorate_Of_Egypt_desc:0 "The land of the Pharaohs is ours at last! The decaying British Empire is gone, the blossoming Italian Empire is here to stay.

    ITA_Move_The_Capital_To_Alexandria_desc:0 "Just like Rome, Alexandria was home to an Empire long ago. The Ptolemaic Kingdom fell to the Roman Empire long ago, and now we have returned to finish the work of Augustus. The new Italian hegemony will not falter as Rome did.

    ITA_Begin_the_Recovery_desc:0 "The crash of 1946 left our nation's economy in shambles, with millions losing their jobs and countless businesses closing their doors. The economic programme of 1948 gave us some amount of breathing room, but there is still much work that is left to be done if we wish to challenge German hegemony in Europe."

    ITA_Initiate_Demobilisation_desc:0 "The war gave Italy a great amount of industrial expansion and technical growth, but our military-facing direction is beginning to generate problems.

    ITA_Implement_Austerity:0 "Implement Austerity"
    ITA_Implement_Austerity_desc:0 "Although the Italian empire is a mighty one, its bureaucracy may be just as large. By cutting down on useless or unnecessary government programmes and procedures, we can generate hard currency for ourselves."
    ITA_Continue_Corporatism:0 "Continue Corporatism"
    ITA_Continue_Corporatism_desc:0 "The past policies of our corporatist economy have served us more than well, and therefore helped us to significantly strengthen the legitimacy of Mussolini's government. We shall continue to further implement these policies from every factory to every field, from the Alps to the coast of Sicily, as to see to it that our economic growth continues. Italy shall soon have one of the best economies in the entire world!"

    ITA_Restart_Foreign_Trade:0 "Restart Foreign Trade"
    ITA_Restart_Foreign_Trade_desc:0 "Italy has been isolated for most of the past decade, focusing on internal issues and on the further integration of its overseas provinces into the Italian Empire rather than making new trade deals with foreign partners. This however has undoubtedly damaged Italy's reputation among its former partners, as well as putting the entire nation into a rather difficult situation with the slowed down production and economic growth due to such drastic actions. We should focus on rekindling relations with our former trade partners in order to strengthen our economic capabilities once more."
    ITA_Land_Redistribution:0 "Land Redistribution"
    ITA_Land_Redistribution_desc:0 "The ownership of land is a matter which is more often than not handled by the authorities of the government rather than by private countrymen. Therefore, a few officials have approached us and suggested to hand out valuable land to members of the Partito Nazionale Fascista, in order to reward those who have proven their true loyalty during peace times as during the Second World War. The ones who these lands belonged to before have no other choice than to obey our orders, although they will certainly not be happy with our decision..."
    ITA_Privatise_the_Banks:0 "Privatise the Banks"
    ITA_Privatise_the_Banks_desc:0 "Since the beginning of fascist rule in 1922, Italian banks have been under state control.

    ITA_Encourage_Tourism_desc:0 "The beauty of the Mediterranean is truly something that is hardly matched by anything else worldwide in the eyes of many. From the Rock of Gibraltar to the Suez, every last corner of this mighty sea holds indescribable beauty, and therefore a potential profit that is to be made. If we were to build up vital tourism hotspots, we would be able to drastically increase the flow of said tourists into our country, and therefore create a great revenue with which we can help to recover the Italian economy.

    ITA_Integrate_Libyan_Economy_desc:0 "The Italian colony of Libya has been very loosely governed from Rome ever since it has been acquired by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1912 after Italian forces defeated the Ottoman Empire shortly beforehand. However, many of our officials are highly doubting that Libya is anywhere near enough integrated into our Empire to be sufficiently exploited  in terms of resources and integrated as an integral part of the Italian nation as a whole. Therefore, a plan has been drafted with which we shall integrate the economical doings of Tripoli into the management of Rome."

    ITA_Expand_the_Steel_Industry_desc:0 "The steel industry in Italy is rather bleak when compared to those of the Germans and British, to say the very least, which puts us at a major disadvantage in terms of production and therefore military buildup. With the lack of steel we're standing in front of an enormous task to build up our capabilities, as to not further fall behind the other World Powers. For this, we have planned to strike several deals with small companies in Genoa and Sicily to unite them into the \"Unione Nazionale Delle Acciaierie\" as to ensure a further increase of productivity, as well as granting the government more power over the entire Italian steel industry."

These very members are demanding that the government takes step to not only ensure more, but total control over all branches of resource gathering as to not only as a means of control, but also the restore the position of the Emperor of the Romans. While this may seem like a far fetched dream, it is undeniable that total control over the industrial sectors would tremendously increase our power beyond anything seen before within Italy..."

The ownership of land is often debated between the countryfolk which owns them and major political figures within the party, which want to expand their own power within the nation by owning large amounts of lands. Considering that we have already started with this in the recent past, and seeing how much this could increase our productivity in the agricultural sector, we should really consider this as it would truly benefit us greatly..."

    ITA_Promote_Investments_in_Southern_Italy_desc:0 "Southern Italy has long been shunned by the Northerners for being undeveloped, too rural, uncultivated and simple too backwards. While most of these assumptions are nothing more than stereotypical assumptions, it is true that the South significantly lacks the Industrial capabilities to compete with the North, or even newly integrated areas of the Empire. We simply cannot let our corelands be underdeveloped in any shape, way or form, so the Government has decided to prepare additional funding to the affected reasons, as well as trying to attract new investors by giving them different kinds of benefits."

In order to further our ongoing plans to expand the Italian tourist industry we shall conduct a massive construction of luxury hotels with which we shall attract even more people from afar to our nation.

From the pride of the fleet it has become the joke of the fleet.

    twritalypolitics.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Italy, or the Italian Empire was masterfully crafted under the guidance of Benito Mussolini, the Duce. He managed to outdo everything the National Fascist Party had done before. With the Italian King now not only Emperor of Ethiopia but also an Emperor of Italy, Italy appeared to be standing at the beginning of a new golden age.\n\nExpanding at the expense of the defeated France and Britain, Italy gained various African territories - Tunisia became Italy's protectorate, with British Somaliland and French Djibouti coming under Italian control. In Europe, some smaller members of the alliance against the Berlin Pact were brought under Rome's aegis: parts of Yugoslavia were gained, and Greece was brought into the Empire.\n\nBut as time dragged on, Mussolini witnessed both the rise and steady fall of Italy, first the breakdown of relationship between Italy and Germany, then the period of economic instability, marked by colonial unrest throughout Ethiopia, Montenegro and Greece. But fortunately, the situation has been mostly stabilized by the start of 1950s, with Italy experiencing a much needed rebound after years of decline. But all of these events under Mussolini's reign has him somewhat of a controversial figure, with signs of secret disapproval slowly appearing amongst the populace. For now, Mussolini can still rest easy, knowing the fact that his popularity is still unmatched, for now."

When Sicily first declared independence, more and more southern regions followed and declared collective independence against the Italian government.\n\nIt is clear that the Kingdom of Italy is heading towards civil war if no drastic actions were taken.

    twritalypolitics.200.d:0 "Il Duce è morto! Mussolini was declared dead today at 8:22 am.\n\nOn waking up at 6:22 am our Duce had his usual cup of coffee and then read an excerpt from 'Bellum Gallicum' (he did so every day). At 7:02 am he received a visit from his daughter, Edda Ciano who stayed for about an hour. Following that Il Duce went for a walk in the garden. It is in the garden that a servant found Il Duce dead.\n\nIt was initially supposed that Mussolini had killed himself: he had exhibited strong signs in the past weeks. Il Duce had a panic attack a few weeks ago after being attacked by a dog with rabbies. From there on he progressively became worse: he became obsessed with Julius Caesar, pretending to be him, he started drinking large quantities of peach juice and cursed without restraint. Furthermore during the night he often used to accuse a myriad of people ranging from Merlin the Wizard to Adolf Hitler for his removal from power. Yet the supposition of suicide was excluded as the autopsy revealed the cause was probably a heart attack.\n\n That having being said, although the official stance is that Il Duce died of natural causes, there have been suspicions that these were not so natural. A wide array of rumours are circulating in the inner circles of the PNF: that Mussolini's early demise would profit Balbo and Ciano. Nonetheless such talks are to be squashed as they are nothing but mere lies.\n\n With Mussolini's death the necessary preparations for the funeral will have to happen and then the Grand Council of Fascism will meet to decide on the next Duce, who is expected to be the one handpicked personally by Mussolini.\n\nWhile it is certainly a distressing event that our great leader has passed, few were hugely surprised. Isolated by his family, friends and former entourage, the once messiniac figure of Italian fascism died as a shadow of its former self. That is the price to pay for power, and the price to pay for failure. Perhaps Il Duce will one day will rank as a tragic figure himself, to the likes of Marc Anthony, Frederick Barbarossa or Julian. Great ambitions, little realizations. May he rest in peace."

The man who attempted this heinous crime was immediately arrested. The King was led to the hospital and was operated on by the best doctors from Greece and Italy. In total the King spent one week in the hospital, recuperating. The perpetrator was quickly given a trial and was found guilty of attempted assasination and high treason (as he was a former Greek Army officer) which would entail a death sentence but was pardonned by the King and his punishment was commuted to a life sentence.

By now, the coup has apparently succeeded without serious opposition.\n\n     It appears now that the country has surrendered itself to Borghese, Graziani, Starace and their men.

Proud members of the Roman race, you are finally ready to retrieve your glory. You have been stiffled, oppressed, led to forsake your destiny.\n\n    But no longer. I am here to liberate, as did Augustus when he sent the vermins, Brutus and Marc Anthony, to their fate, and he himself, Augustus, brought Rome to its golden age. I have thus removed two scums, Benito and Italo, and although the leeches have escaped, they are irrelevant anymore.\n\n    Today a new era begins, where we lay behind our past. Fascist will be reborn under a new noble and human face, that of Aristocratic Fascism, where men will only be defined by their worth and it is their worth which will determine their status in society. The brave and fortuous shall be Kings, and the weak rats will be the Serfs.\n\n     And as a matter of fact, the 'Kingdom of Italy' is abolished once for all, and instead we may now call ourselves the Empire of Italy led by myself as the Imperator of the Empire. Imperator not in the twisted definition the contemporary royals have given to the title, but Imperator in the sense of ancients, when the Emperors of the past lived their life in the battlefield and sought to create what is called the illustrious 'Roman Empire'.\n\n     My goal is not to promote any silly nationalist concept, or anything like that. No, us Italians are fit to rule the world because that is our role, and it is our mission to do so. Whoever submits to Rome willfully will become one of the Romans, whoever does not, well he better flee the advance of the Legions!\n\n     Now the time has come to fullfill our destiny. Ave Caesar.

Despite the fact they know of the country's dire situation they act in an entirely unpatriotic fashion and refuse to stand down and continue their work. Already the strikes appear to be spreading to other cities in the vincinity, in Brescia, Milano and Pavia and it is imperative we make them stand down, no matter the means.\n\n  Count Ciano, always a rationalist, proposes that we very simply send the Army and Police to restore order, and if necessary use lethal fire. While this method is undoubtedly effective it will increase dissent in Northern Italy and dissapoint the Grand Council of Fascism.\n  On the other hand, Italo Balbo, due to his own sympathy for the working class, has proposed that we negotiate with the strikers and attempt to assuage their demands. Success is less sure but it will surely improve our standing with the populace, at the expense of dissapointing the Blackshirts and hardliners.\n\n  No matter whose solution we chose, we must act now and act with a firm hand."

Born to one of Rome's oldest noble families, the House of Borghese, he was nurtured into a life of luxury early on. In 1929 however he decided to join the Regia Marina and from there on promotions followed quickly: in 1933 appointed submarine commander, serving in Ethiopia and in Spain.\n\nHe quickly distinguished himself as an apt commander and when the war with the United Kingdom erupted he was appointed commander of the elite Decima Flotiglia MAS, where he piooneered naval commando's. Despite the short war, Borghese was able to achieve great success by causing severe damage to British and French ships. After the end of the war, Borghese was from done with his fight. He applied to volunteer with the German Kriegsmarine to destroy the Red threat once for all. His service in the Baltic Sea was once again a great success and he even managed to sink a Soviet battleship. He won the German Pour le Mérite on special intervention by Karl Dönitz, becoming the most recent foreigner to earn the prestigious order.\n\nBorghese's experience in the war had however changed him. He realised how backwards the Italian people were, only mere shadows of Ancient Rome, he realised how antiquated a monarchy was which was based on some worthless titles. Borghese set out to work on his master plan for the rebirth of Rome out of Italy's ashes and at the same time destroy what he perceives as the 'Anglo-Germanic Hegemony'. He envisions an Aristocratic Imperial Fascist State where every man is judged based only on his abilities. Borghese wants to recreate the societal structure of Ancient Rome but with the only distinction being merit. And indeed Borghese wants Italians to dedicate themselves to war and empire building with as much ruthlessness as their ancestors. And he will do everything possible to ensure Rome is reborn..."

    TOOLTIP_ITALIAN_GUI_BALBO:0 "§YItalo Balbo§! is one of the original Quadrumvirs, the four men who lead the March on Rome which resulted in the Fascist takeover, and by far the youngest.\n\nHe has made himself famous with his aerial exploits, has made great improvements to the Regia Aeronautica (the Italian Air Force) and has significantly improved the quality of life in Libya.\n\nBalbo is perhaps the most known Fascist internationally after the Duce himself, and is extremely popular with the common people of the Empire. He oversees the §YColonial and Military§! affairs of the Empire. Balbo enjoys the support of the Monarchy, the trade unions and the liberalising PNF members in his fight for the control of Italy against §YGaleazzo Ciano§!"
    TOOLTIP_ITALIAN_GUI_MUSSOLINI:0 "§YBenito Mussolini§! is the Father of the Nation, the proudest representative of the Roman Race and certainly the man who overtook what was back in 1922 a poor broken nation and remade it in the image of his ancient Latin forefathers.\n\nIn reality however Mussolini has been kept isolated within the stunning Palazzo Chigi in Rome. He has become a real hostage in the hands of Galeazzo Ciano and Italo Balbo who control Italy. Mussolini serves as a figurehead and nothing more.\n\nThe Monarchy has disavowed him and the PNF considers him, privately, an idiot. Italy's near defeat against Greece certainly did not help the regime, nor did the financial crisis or the severe instability plaguing the country. Mussolini has become a scapegoat, righteously or not, and he is credited with Italy's dire situation."

    twritalyforeign.797979.d:0 "While the state of San Marino is ostensibly a democracy, all parties other than the Sammarinese Fascist Party have been banned since 1926, essentially making it a fascist state. Following the ideology of Italian Fascism, relations are good, and little change has occurred since the 1920s. Today the Sammarinese general elections were held, and the SFP predictably held 100% of seats, with Giuliano Gozi once again serving as party leader."

    twritalyforeign.7979791.d:0 "Following the regime change in Italy, San Marino's fascist regime fell into utter chaos. Without the legitimacy provided by the Italians, the Sammarinese Fascist Party was challnged by a coalition of Sammarinese rebels. The revolution occurred a day ago, with both sides consisting of a handful of armed militia, the rebels successfully occupied the majority of San Marino, managing to secure all access points from San Marino to Italy. The fascist supporters barricaded themselves within the Palazzo Pubblico, they fought on for two hours, surrendering after three of their men were severely injured.\n\nWhen the barricades were cleared and with San Marino firmly within rebel control, the rebels marched into Palazzo Pubblico, formally declaring the formation of a new transitional government for the Most Serene Republic."

    twritalyforeign.8080.d:0 "When the French-German War broke out, the son of Charlotte I of Monaco fought for the French forces, and followed their forces into French West Africa, proclaiming his loyalty to the French Republic as an officer. Despite our demands for his return, Rainier refused to return, stating that his fight against fascism and his heart for the French Republic has not yet faded. And throughout these years, Rainier endured a soldier's life in the wastelands of Africa.\n\nBut due to recent events, it was clear that Monaco needed her prince more than ever before, while Rainer's heart for France is devoted, his loyalty towards Monaco finally convinced him. After a dangerous trip, Rainer's ship was spotted a few miles away from Monaco, and he was greeted by cheering crowds when he finally set foot on Monaco after years of self-imposed exile.\n\nThe Prince is back, and he will guide Monaco out of these troubling times."
