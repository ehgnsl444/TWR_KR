####Focus
POR_God_Homeland_Family:0 "God, Homeland, Family"
POR_God_Homeland_Family_desc:0 "António de Oliveira Salazar has defended Portugal and its empire for 20 years now. It was he who kept Portugal safe from both the machinations of the British and German empires and it is he who will continue to oversee Portugal for years to come. The Estado Novo will not fail!"
POR_Continue_Freedom_of_Press:0 "Continue Freedom of the Press"
POR_Continue_Freedom_of_Press_desc:0 "Over the years the Estado Novo regime has seen fit to liberalise somewhat. Though still under the watchful eye of our government the continued liberalisation and greater freedoms to the press will surely be appreciated by our population."
POR_Roll_Back_on_Liberalization_Reforms:0 "Back Down on Liberal Reforms"
POR_Roll_Back_on_Liberalization_Reforms_desc:0 "The world is a dangerous and increasingly volatile place. If we open up our nation too much, the imperialist hawks to our west and east will pounce and tear Portugal down. Or the ever present bolshevik enemy will rip the empire apart from within. The Estado Novo has worked too much to let our beautiful nation fail now. We won't give up an inch."
POR_Expand_State_Surveillance:0 "Expand the PIDE"
POR_Expand_State_Surveillance_desc:0 "Portugal's internal police force, the Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado, has been the main bulwark against both fascism and communism. Since 1933 they have ensured the continued prosperity of the Estado Novo status-quo. As the world begins to heat up again, the PIDE must be expanded."

POR_Purge_Government_Threats:0 "The Red Threat Act"
POR_Purge_Government_Threats_desc:0 "Despite their overlords in Russia's defeat, the forces of bolshevism still remain throughout the world. Portugal is not exempt from this unfortunate list of nations, and we must be on our guard. The Red Threat Act will give greater powers to PIDE and other security service personnel in the fight against the red enemy. They will not be given any breathing space."
POR_As_Free_as_in_Free_England:0 "As Free as in Free England!"
POR_As_Free_as_in_Free_England_desc:0 "The Portuguese people are proud of our republican system and rightly so! Though our early years were troublesome, now the Estado Novo have secured our republican heritage. Our people shall be told that they have the same liberties and freedoms as our British compatriots. Britain has an empire and a democracy, why can't Portugal have the same?"
POR_Enshrine_Civil_Rights:0 "Enshrine Portuguese Rights"
POR_Enshrine_Civil_Rights_desc:0 "The Portuguese peoples, who have upheld the Estado Novo for so long, deserve the basic human rights any decent person who lives on this planet seeks. Salazar shall promise to uphold these rights, now and forever. A new age for Portugal is approaching."
POR_Not_Equal_But_Respected:0 "Soften Colonial Relations"
POR_Not_Equal_But_Respected_desc:0 "Though the Portuguese people need not know of it, sometimes we are required to use somewhat brutal force to retain our position in Africa. However it's becoming apparent we are facing an increasingly hostile populace. Perhaps a lighter touch may bring the population in line."
POR_Illusion_at_home:0 "The Public Knows Peace"
POR_Illusion_at_home_desc:0 "Though few in number and purely annoying in nature, it cannot be denied that resistance is growing. The Portuguese public still need not know of these issues. They will see a prosperous colony with a happy population...they cannot know of the true state of things..."
POR_Plan_for_Popular_Education:0 "Plan for Popular Education"
POR_Plan_for_Popular_Education_desc:0 "Portugal is not the empire it once was, but we still persist. The economic downturns of the last few decades have seen our education sector take a massive hit. With the economy growing ever more stable, a new and rejuvenated programme for education may be proposed."
POR_Colonial_Education_Investments:0 "Invest in Colonial Education"
POR_Colonial_Education_Investments_desc:0 "In time we will need to give our colonies greater autonomy, and relinquish most of its internal matters to the local colonial population. However if this is to happen a massive reform of the education sector in our colonies must be undertaken quickly!"
POR_Maintain_the_Picture:0 "Maintain the Liberal Idea"

POR_Draw_Closer_to_the_UK_desc:0 "The Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is the oldest in the world, and British democracy is also an old system which has survived the test of time. Though a monarchy, we should look to the British democratic system to inspire our own."

POR_Colonial_Status_Report_1952_desc:0 "Portugal's Empire is among the oldest in the world. Though diminished, it still stands tall with the other colonial powers. Our colonies of Angola and Mozambique are restless however. The government has requested a full review and status report of our colonial holdings in Africa, to determine their future role in close cooperation with the homeland."
POR_Promote_Lusotropicalism:0 "The Lusotropicalist Doctrine"
POR_Promote_Lusotropicalism_desc:0 "Portuguese colonialism is a mostly humane affair. Unlike the other European powers, who have committed barbarous acts to retain their footholds, we have treated the natives with as much respect as they deserve. Any who say otherwise seek to bring Portugal and her Empire down."
POR_Continued_Colonial_Censorship:0 "Correct Overseas Media"
POR_Continued_Colonial_Censorship_desc:0 "Certain western media stations, especially in the United States, have criticized our continued presence in Africa. We say to them however, could they be more hypocritical? Did the United States not seize Spanish colonial possessions for themselves, and does the British Empire not continue to waddle on to an uncertain future. We must ensure that they see Portuguese colonialism for what it is. A humane and just project bringing civilisation to a desolate and dark continent."
POR_White_Settlers_to_the_Colonies:0 "Expand the African Crioulos Population"
POR_White_Settlers_to_the_Colonies_desc:0 "The Crioulos in our African colonies make up a huge percentage of our colonial population. Most criollos are loyal to the Portuguese flag, therefore efforts should be made to expand and develop this population.

POR_Crackdown_on_African_Nationalism_desc:0 "So called “freedom fighters” are causing mass terror and destruction throughout our Angolan colony.

POR_Guarantee_American_Support_desc:0 "The Portuguese military was far from ready for the situation it finds itself in.

POR_Second_Azores_Lease:0 "The Second Azores Lease"
POR_Second_Azores_Lease_desc:0 "The islands of the Azores are of emmese strategic value to whoever owns it. In the 1940s, under immense pressure from the British and Americans we leased these islands for use as air bases to deter German U-boat aggression. It seems the Toronto Accord are very interested in using the islands again, as the threat of a renewed war with Germany increases."
POR_Neutral_Peninsular_Policy:0 "Neutral Peninsular Policy"
POR_Neutral_Peninsular_Policy_desc:0 "Portugal has no interest in conquest nore a war of any description. The Toronto Accord also seems to want to respect these wishes, with a condition. The Accord does not want to deal with our Spanish cousins, and has asked for representatives from Portugal to enter discussions with the Spanish government on a unified foreign policy in the name of neutrality."
POR_Hire_Foreign_Merchants:0 "Use Paramilitary Forces"
POR_Hire_Foreign_Merchants_desc:0 "Many of our commanders are sending constant complaints that they do not have the necessary number of troops to effectively combat the insurgents in Angola. The colonial government has made the suggestion that ad-hoc units composed of civilian colonists be formed. These units will take multiple roles, mostly behind the lines operations to free up our standard forces."

POR_Battle_Against_Corruption:0 "The Battle against Corruption"
POR_Battle_Against_Corruption_desc:0 "As is the result of any dictatorship, corruption has had the time and freedom to breed and develop deep within almost all frames of life. Our parliament, military, justice system, civil service and so many other administrative bodies have decayed to the point of no long being able to operate efficiently. President Delgado has rallied around him all he can truly trust, for corruption is about to meet its match."
POR_The_Liberal_President:0 "The Fearless General"
POR_The_Liberal_President_desc:0 "Humberto da Silva Delgado, called by some the “Fearless General”, has successfully been elected president and in effect forced Estado Novo from power. Once an enthusiastic supporter of the regime, over the years Delgado has grown increasingly liberal in his views. With his entry into power, the torch of liberty may once again truly shine on Portugal."
POR_Obviously_Ill_Dismiss_Him:0 "Obviously, I'll Dismiss Him!"
POR_Obviously_Ill_Dismiss_Him_desc:0 "The days of Salazar are over. President Delgado has the authority and influence at last to keep a promise he made to the press when asked what he would do with the prime minister if elected president. His answer was very simple “Obviously I'll dismiss him”."
POR_Washington_of_Portugal:0 "The Washington of Lisbon"
POR_Washington_of_Portugal_desc:0 "George Washington is the American embodiment of freedom and liberty. General Delgado could become another despot of Portugal, and the wheel will keep on turning. But Delgado does not fear the thugs of Estado Novo, and he shall ensure Portugal is free not just on paper, but in reality also."
POR_Introduce_Fair_Elections:0 "Introduce Fair Elections"
POR_Introduce_Fair_Elections_desc:0 "The Portuguese people have had fraudulent election after election almost since the inception of the republic. This trend is about to come to a crashing end.

POR_Align_with_the_Toronto_Accord_desc:0 "With Portugal finally joining the free world, our international status has changed irreversibly. The German Reich will seek to destroy us now, therefore we must align fully with the Toronto Accord. If only as a deterrent to German and Spanish hostility."
POR_Sack_the_Secret_Police:0 "Disband the PIDE"
POR_Sack_the_Secret_Police_desc:0 "The scum of the Estado Novo regime can be embodied in one institution, the PIDE. For 20 years this organisation has stamped on and kicked the Portuguese people down. None within the PIDE shall be safe from retribution."
POR_Reform_the_Airforce:0 "Expand the Airforce"
POR_Reform_the_Airforce_desc:0 "As an air force general, President Delgado naturally has a love for the air wing of our armed forces. In modern warfare the power of the aircraft is undeniable and Portugal has fallen behind. We should look to foreign designs to expand our airforce."
POR_End_the_Lusitropical_Myth:0 "Debunk the Lusotropicalist Myth"
POR_End_the_Lusitropical_Myth_desc:0 "The truth of our colonies has been carefully concealed by the Estado Novo regime for years. Where the population sees a prospering and happy colony, the reality is that our colonies are increasingly unstable and riddled with violence. Any remaining Estado Novo supporters will lose all credibility when the Portuguese people know the truth."
POR_Formalize_Democracy:0 "American-Based Democracy"
POR_Formalize_Democracy_desc:0 "The United States of America: the nation many dream to visit and stay for it is the land of liberty, opportunity and freedom. Portugal requires a massive overhaul of our political system to prevent another Estado Novo rising. America shall be our model!"



####Idea
POR_status_of_africa:0 "Status of África"
POR_status_of_africa_desc:0 "Reports from our colonies overseas are constantly flooding to floors of the Portuguese parliament. They all paint a picture of colonial savagery, not from the local population but from the armed forces and colonial administration. While the Portuguese colonists have seemingly good relations with their black counterparts, the military and bureaucracy are still fond of the old colonial policy and mentality regarding the native population. Paid serfdom still plagues the colonies of Angola and Mozambique, while East Timor clearly feels the increasing pressure of independence movements. As we read this all and take it in, we realise that the colonies are messy. Too messy, in fact, for the public to notice! Thus, we shall never reveal this truth to our population and continue our age-old message of Lusotropicalism and civilization missions, as that will surely work forever."
POR_no_opposition:0 "Non-Existent Opposition"
POR_no_opposition_desc:0 "Since the 1940s, Salazar's regime allowed some liberal reforms as a way to please the people and the liberal opposition that was oh-so nostalgious for the former Portuguese Republic and its ‘free elections'. While Salazar has allowed turning-down censorship activities and the return of elections to Portugal, many of these progressive reforms have often been just a smokescreen for his enemies and a grand gesture to the people of Portugal to create more support for its charismatic dictator. Opposition exists, but is highly fractured and manipulated by the dominant National Union of the Estado Novo, keeping the threat of opposition as low as possible. Currently, the only actual opposition to Salazar and his parafascist state is to be found outside of Portugal or hidden in the cracks of the New State, such as the military."
POR_hotbed_of_spies:0 "Hotbed of Spies"
POR_hotbed_of_spies_desc:0 "Since the beginning of the Second World War, Portugal has become a major point of connection in the spying world. Eyes from all parties that were involved in the war have once planted their feet on Portuguese soil and have used Portugal as a perfect cover against enemy counterespionage. While the war ended, the spying activities of all involved nations did not and Portugal continues to be an important hub for tactical intelligence gathering to this day, with the Portuguese government allowing it to happen. \n\n§RSuch foreign influence could be dangerous one day.§!"

###Events
twrportugal.1.t:0 "Iberian Pact - Defensive War Protocol"
twrportugal.1.d:0 "A recent collapse in the diplomatic game has forced our nation to war. However, due to us not having instigated the conflict, we can easily call upon our Iberian brothers in the name of defending the peninsula from foreign influence."
twrportugal.1.a:0 "Call upon the pact"
twrportugal.1.b:0 "We can do it ourselves"
twrportugal.2.t:0 "Iberian Pact - Friend in Need"
twrportugal.2.d:0 "Due to a recent crash in diplomacy, our Iberian brother has been locked into a defensive war against foreign aggresion. While we are seemingly not part of this conflict, our signing of the Iberian Pact does force us to help them, unless we want to be seen as disloyal to the global order."
twrportugal.2.a:0 "We shall help!"
twrportugal.2.b:0 "How about no?"
twrportugal.3.t:0 "Iberian Pact - End of the War"
twrportugal.3.d:0 "With the return of peace to Iberia and its nations, the Iberian Pact may disband its military alliance till the next conflict involving the peninsula."
twrportugal.3.a:0 "Okay"
twrportugal.6.t:0 "Salazar adresses the Cabinet"
twrportugal.6.d:0 "Recently, Portugal has enjoyed a period of relative stability and welfare under Salazar's regime: The end of the Second World War brought peace to a broken continent and the worldtrade regained momentum once more. While Portugal's economy has become akin to an autarky in the hands of the New State, this global economic impuls even reached Portugal, introducing new, modern consumer products such as television and refrigirators. The industry of Portugal has also seen general improvement under Salazar's protectionist and nationalist economic policies, as it has been allowed to grow without the pressure of foreign competition completely squashing the little Portuguese market. \n\nHowever, not everything is great in Portugal. Illiteracy is still rather high for an European nation, only being surpassed by the German reichskommissariaten and its native populations, which is not something we can be proud of. Another issue is the increasingly unstable situation in Angola and the other African colonies. African nationalism has become a major trend across the continent, represented in the conflicts Spain and Belgium have found themselves in, and Angola is not different in that case. All of these issues eventually regard the liberalization reforms, which Portugal has been following since the late 1940s. There are both proponents as opponents and Salazar has an interest in solving this divide as soon as possible."
twrportugal.6.a:0 "The press shall remain free"
twrportugal.6.b:0 "We've been using this façade for way too long!"
twrportugal.7.t:0 "The Colonial Congress"
twrportugal.7.d:0 "The issues our colonial nation faces have become unbearable for the Lisbon government. Thus, Salazar has made the decision to meet with all colonial governments in Porto to discuss the future of Portugal's colonial empire. Several big issues will be talked about during this congress, such as: \n\n-The complete economic ruin Timor has found itself in \n\n-The civil unrest present in Angola and Mozambique \n\n-The neglection of Portuguese Guinea \n\nWith all colonial governors around the table, we will finally be able to discuss the future plans of development and administrative progression this month and hopefully bring an end to the bad situation across the seas."
twrportugal.7.a:0 "Let's talk colonies"
twrportugal.8.t:0 "The Issue of Portuguese Timor"
twrportugal.8.d:0 "Since the end of the Second World War, East Timor has experienced total economic ruins due to the Japanese invasion of the island. The Battle of Timor has cost many Portuguese and native lives and has devestated the former colonial economy of the island. While rebuilding the colony has been going on for almost 7 years now, the economy still remains a shadow of of its former self and many do not expect the island nation to recover in this decade, unless Portugal involves itself in the rebuilding process of the colony. Opponents have warned Salazar for the corrupt sinkhole, as many suspect that the money Lisbon will send will end up in the hands of the local government for personal expenses. A small faction of these opponents have even started to promote the idea of a Portuguese-Timorese commonwealth, integrating Timor fully into the Portuguese Lisbon administration as to dodge the issue of corruption."
twrportugal.8.a:0 "They will not see a single Escudo from us!"
twrportugal.8.b:0 "Lisbon has to support its tropical brother"
twrportugal.8.c:0 "Entertain the idea of the commonwealth integration proposal"
twrportugal.9.t:0 "Unrest in Angola and Mozambique"
twrportugal.9.d:0 "The administration of the colonies of Portuguese Angola and Mozambique have recently been flooded with reports on civil unrest. Reports on border raids organized by the UPNA and the PCA have become common place, as both organizations are able to effectively operate outside of Angola, in the borderregions of the Belgian Congo and British Rhodesia. Another issue is the civil unrest among the mostly agrarian natives, a group which has now organized itself under several native unions against European exploitation. Labour protests and guerilla warfare have become as normal as the daily cup of coffee one may enjoy after waking up in Angola, as the Portuguese military continues to be divided, lacking any coordination between the 3 main branches. The colonial government has thus asked Lisbon for an tremendous amount of cash to deal with the developing problem."
twrportugal.9.a:0 "We have to secure our colonies"
twrportugal.10.t:0 "Neglection of Portuguese Guinea"
twrportugal.10.d:0 "The colony of Portuguese Guinea has been a poor backwater, even for colonial standards, with its colonial government being one of the poorest in our empire. Guinea's economy is completely based on agriculture, exporting peanuts and vegetable oil to Lisbon, accounting for 1/3 of our needs. While several paternalistic governors have tried to develop the colony, little to no infrastructure has made any actual development impossible. An upsurge in the sleeping sickness has also endangered the population of the colony, as healthcare is far from a basic right in Guinea. It's unknown if the population of 500,000 will even be able to sustain its current economy, as shortages have become too usual for the colony. The colonial governor, Sarmento Rodrigues, has been adamant about asking Lisbon for the development support Guinea needs, citing that Guinea's neglection has gone too far."
twrportugal.10.a:0 "Guinea will not be forgotten!"
twrportugal.10.b:0 "We have more relevant places to develop"
twrportugal.11.t:0 "Delgado's Opportunity"
twrportugal.11.d:0 "The sounds of marching boots and screeching iron echoed through the streets of Lisbon. As the army marched on the paved ways of the capital, Delgado became increasingly delighted by the prospect of the near future. His plans were set in motion after Salazar's failure to properly solve the Angolan situation. The increasingly violent war that has been fought in the former Portuguese colony of Angola became a war dispised by the populace and hated by the army. Few men opposed Delgado's proposed coup d'état, which had been carefully planned and organized by himself and several other military commanders, including president Francisco Craveiro Lopes himself. With support from both the inside and outside of the Portuguese government, Delgado had decided that today was the day to execute his plan. \n\nThe early morning sun had yet to reach Salazar's face when he was violently awakened by a couple of armed soldiers. His suspicion grew when the face of Humberto Delgado entered his room. Salazar did had no other explanation for him and his soldiers in his house, other than an ongoing coup. \"Do not say a word, old man\" Delgado said. \"I'm here to rid Portugal of a plague that has affected this country for several decades by now: your fascist government and its lies\".

twrportugal.12.d:0 "The growing unrest in our Angolan colony has started to become a major issue and has halted most, if not all, Angolan development projects in the region. The two major parties involved in this unrest are the UPNA and the PCA. The UPNA (United People of Northern Angola) have waged a small guerilla war against the Portuguese armed forces since 1950, representing the interests of the Bakongo people living in Northern Angola. Their war has brought a major halt to stability in Cabinda and the northern ports of Angola and several government sources seem to think that the German Empire could be involved in supporting the autocratic group in Northern Angola. However, these accusations remain without proof. \n\nThe CPA, on the other hand, has been quite silent, prefering a subversive campaign against the Portuguese colonists. They've spread rumours and propaganda, fueling the flame of African nationalism and anti-colonialist marxism in the Angolan colony. Their campaign, however, has been spread thin across Angola and their power is thus less concentrated than the UPNA. The security act proposed by the colonial ministry should gift the colonial administration of Angola temporary power to combat the issue. The main problem with the proposal is that the colony can only focus its resources on one issue, due to the scale of the groups involved."

We can assure the Portuguese people that the governments that replace our former colonies will be educated by us, as to prepare them for the modern age of liberty and democracy\". \n\nDelgado's speech came to a shock to many Portuguese, their worldview shattered to pieces. The population beliefs that Portuguese colonialism had been relatively great compared to the brutality of the British, French, Dutch and Belgian colonies. However, these are mere lies, promoting the lusotropical myth. To debunk this myth is the first step to freedom for Delgado."

The process was rather long and drawnout, as Salazar's appointed attorney tried every trick in the book to fool the judges into thinking that Salazar was not as guilty as they presumed. However, countless witnesses testified against Salazar, exposing the authoritarian crimes he was guilty of, such as criminalizing the opposition, holding fake elections, bribes and using the secret police to surpress dissident. Salazar was eventually found guilty of all accused crimes and is sentenced to exile. His departure from Portugal has been arranged for tomorrow."

However, Delgado had once more promised his partners and allies the stability of democracy. His democracy, established with blood, sweat and tears wouldn't fall to the communist menace, nor would it fall into civil conflict like the Second Spanish Republic. His promises, accompanied with his fame as bringer of democracy among the people have calmed many."

Several prominent members of Salazar's cabinet, such as Paulo Cunha and José Carvalho, were seized and killed by the army, effectively ending the Estado Novo regime. Humberto Delgado has already declared his appreciation of liberal democracy, which he had been able to experience during his time in the United States, and his future plans for the Portuguese Republic: A step-by-step strategy with the intention to return democracy to the Portuguese mainland. Delgado is also a fierce proponent of decolonisation and his ascension to power has guaranteed a peace treaty with Angola."

However, Portuguese colonialism in the region has recently met a new challenge in the form of African nationalism: a trend that has endangered the security of the colonies. The Portuguese administration was, however, unprepared for this morning's event, as thousands of Angolese militias rose up in the eastern provinces. Under the leadership of Mário Pinto de Andrade, the Angolan Communist Party has formed a coalition with other nationalist parties. Inspired by the previous Moroccan rebellion and the Congolese, Andrade's front has started its struggle against imperialism. The Portuguese armed forces have yet to properly respond, due to poor coordination between the armed forces, the navy and the airforce."

The UNPA was formed in 1953 by Holden Roberto as a seperatist movement for the Bakongo tribe who wished to refound the old feudal kingdom of the Kongo. However, their cause grew to include the issue of forced labour in the colony, appealing to more and more Angolan workers. This morning, thousands of Roberto's troops were able to cross the Angolan-Belgian border, massacring hundreds of white settlers, Bailundo's, African catholics and tribal members other than the Bakongo tribe. While this attack has dented their popularity among the people of Angola, their rebellion continues to stay strong in Northern Angola."

twrportugal.100.d:0 "The German Reich may hold tight to continental Europe, Portugal continues its existance, isolated from most German influence. The Second World War barely affected the nation of Portugal, as it was spared from both an allied or axis invasion. While the nation of Portugal remained neutral during the conflict, it did support the allied powers through trade and leasing the islands of the Azores. Their support helped American fighters and bombers fight alongside the Commonwealth in Europe and kept the British Empire from completely falling apart. \n\nThe years after the Second World War have been quite stable: Under Antonio Salazar, the dictator of the Portuguese Republic, Portugal has experienced an economic revitalization. Even if Portugal remains one of the least wealthy nations in Europe, Salazar's nationalist economics shielded the young Portuguese industry from ruthless foreign competition, allowing it to slowly grow overtime. Economic progress has gone hand in hand with reforming the education system, as a large portion of the population still is illiterate. The main issue Portugal faces today, however, isn't one of economics or even colonial in nature (even if the colonies are coming apart at the seems), but diplomatic: The cold war between the liberal titan and the nazi beast have started to divide Iberia, as Spain slowly drifts in the Axis sphere of influence, while Portugal stood loyal to the Allied cause. This division should be adressed in the near future if Iberia wants to continue being one of the most stable regions in Europe currently."

Few sons want to die in the jungles of Africa for the glory of Portugal, as many do not feel any attachment to this idea of Portuguese imperium. Their draft dodging isn't the problem though: the problem is the unpopularity of the war among the military ranks, as only a few military officers belief that Portugal can effectively stabilize Angola. Those that do not belief in this war rally behind Humberto Delgado, the infamous People's General and the face of liberal opposition to Salazar."

twrportugal.101.t:0 "The Colonial Status of 1952"
twrportugal.101.d:0 "It's no secret to anyone working under Salazar that things are bad in Portuguese Africa. All available evidence indicates that they're about to get worse. The stunning defeats of the United Kingdom and the USSR threw the established global order into disarray. The colonial empires of old are crumbling like sugar in coffee. Our grip on our overseas territories was never firm at the best of times, but independence movements are quickly gaining traction there. Portugese rule is deeply unpopular in the African colonies, where most Africans lack citizenship and towns are segregated along ethnic lines. A lack of opportunity has driven numerous natives into the arms of dangerous radicals like the Cabral brothers in Guinea-Bissau and Samora Machel in Mozambique.\n\nThe worst of the instability is in Angola, where our colonial forces have gotten embroiled in what's rapidly become a low-level civil war. Native guerillas have gotten increasingly bold with their terrorist attacks. Operating from bases in the lawless wilderness of the Belgian Congo, the United People of Northern Angola (UPNA) under Holden Roberto has launched numerous raids on Portuguese settlements. The Angolan Communist Party (ACP) is likewise growing in strength despite having been declared illegal, resulting in incidents of violence directed at state actors in near Luena and Luau.\n\nThe economic opportunities currently available to Angolans and other Africans are meager. Their poor living conditions are directly feeding into their growing desire for independence and self-determination. The prime minister is insistent that our colonial subjects can still be “civilized” and perhaps integrated one day if preventive measures are taken. More troops will be stationed in Africa to dissuade rebellion but this is (at best) a temporary solution. The trials ahead will put Portugal's policy of pluricontentalism to the ultimate test."

There wasn't a single locale that was beyond the reach of our merchant fleets or the Armada Portuguesa. It seems like we had all the spice and riches in the world for a time, but now it's just another memory. We became complacent. Decadent. One by one our Indian and Chinese ports passed into the hands of spry, younger competitors. Goa, Macau, East Timor and a few smaller Indian ports are all that remains of our Asian holdings. There is nothing else besides it. \n\nWhat we still have may be more fleeting than the prime minister would like to admit. With independence movements taking hold across Africa and Asia, the nationalist fervor is already taking root in our overseas ports. Although the people of Goa are largely content with our rule, there's a real possibility that one of the Indian states will be emboldened by their newfound independence to reclaim the city. More worrying is how the Chinese government has worked tirelessly over the years to reunite the region under the Kuomintang's banner. It's no secret that many in China would like to see Macau and the other treaty ports reunited with the mainland, so the popular support for an invasion already exists. The prime minister's cabinet is keenly aware that Portugal would be severely outgunned and outmanned in a confrontation with China should violence break out. \n\nWhile the situation isn't as precarious as that of our African colonies, the future of Portuguese Asia is tense and uncertain. We shouldn't deceive ourselves, we are not the great power we used to be. Portguese clippers loaded down with tea leaf and spice have sailed the Indian ocean for centuries. Even today these trade routes are a much-needed source of revenue for our ailing economy. Will that too be yet another memory?"
