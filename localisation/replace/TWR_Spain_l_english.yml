SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Spain stands today, almost 15 years since the end of the Spanish Civil War, united under its great dictator Francisco Franco, leader of the military junta and of the national movement, the only legally allowed party of the Spanish State. Most of the former Republican menace has either vanished, been purged or has gone to exile, leavin Spain relatively stable. With the nazi victory in Europe and Africa, Spain was able to quickly take Morocco from the Free French Forces, comparable to a vulture eating from a rotting animal, and established a Spanish protectorate. Spain now stands on the verge of colonial conflict, as the Moroccan project has been ignored for too long."
TWR_FRANCO:0 "Francisco Franco, known by his Spanish allies as the Caudillo of Spain, has ruled the unstable state for around a decade now. The dictator, having been rather succesfull in establishing his base of power, has yet to settle down into his power, still fearing republican treachery and seeing danger in the growing student population of Spain. \nFranco, as a former soldier and commander in the Rif war, has had a general interest in the Berber-Arabic region of Morocco, making the Moroccan project his passion project, wanting to fulfill it before the end of 1952. Franco has put much into the project, promoting it as a prestige project for the entire Spanish state, comparable to the inquisition and reconquista. He happily awaits the day that Morocco becomes a core Spanish region."
BLANCO_DESC:0 "Luis Carrero Blanco, known as The Most Excellent among the Cortes, was born on the 4th of march, 1904, in Santoña, Cantabria. He entered the Naval Military Academy at the age of 14 and participated in the infamous Rif War, making him part of the old nationalist gaurd. When the civil war broke out, Blanco was able to reach the nationalist frontline by taking his refuge in the embassy of Mexico and later in the embassy of France. At the end of the civil war, Blanco had planted himself as one of Franco's closest allies, becoming the chief of naval operations. His power would become a major tool for the Opus Dei in the Franco government, as he aspired to closer economic integration with the European markets, though never outright becoming a proponent of liberalization. As a devout catholic, Blanco is seen by many as the perfect succesor of Franco, though some question his decision-making skills when facing pressure."
SUAREZ_DESC:0 "Adolfo Suárez has become a major figure for Spanish liberals. One of the few figureheads of the disunited student movement, the young Suarez has been a proponent of liberal democracy at a slow pace for a long time. Having studied law at the Salamanca university, he got into politics at a rather young age. While he's a major figure in the student movement, he's currently only appointed as the transitional head of state for Spain, prior to the first student congress, which will appoint a democratically elected president."

SPA_Clarify_the_Line_of_Succession_desc:0 "Since the death of Alfonso Carlos, the Carlist cause has been split due to the laws of succession. While most support Prince Xavier, many also support Prince Jaimie of the line of the former king of Spain, Alfonso XIII. This split played a huge role in our inability to unite against Franco and his personal ambitions. Even still some call Xavier’s ascendancy to the throne illegitimate, it's clear a drastic change to the laws of succession is required to secure our power base."

It is believed that the soon to be King is not as loyal to the Franco regime as once thought, with links to some “radical” groups being found. Don Juan is a threat to the national security of Spain, an urgent shift in policy must be made!"
SPA_Crownn_Jaime_Instead:0 "Crown Alfonso Instead"
SPA_Crownn_Jaime_Instead_desc:0 "Don Juan must be put to the side, but we cannot leave the throne vacant. Don Juan has two sons, his eldest is Juan Carlos.

SPA_placate_the_monarchists_desc:0 "The Spanish Civil War led to a huge stream of monarchists rallying the nationalist banner against the republic, as they saw their chance of restoring the old kingdom.

SPA_placate_the_catholics_desc:0 "The Christian Catholic Church of Spain has been a major pillar for the Francoist regime since the beginning of the uprising of 1936, as the anti-clerical republic basically shoved most christians into the arms of the nationalist side.

Hundreds were camped along the roads; hundreds were plodding north toward Barcelona, their few possessions, mattresses, blankets, (...) on their backs, in the wheelbarrows or on their burros' backs. Little children were walking, holding onto their mother's skirts; women carried babies; older children were driving goats and sheep; old men were helping old women along the road; their faces were impassive, dark with the dust of the roads and fields, lined and worn. Their eyes were bright but there was no expression in their eyes.

####Events
twrspain.1.t:0 "The Casablanca Conference"
twrspain.1.d:0 "Delegates from Morocco, Spain and Italy have arrived this morning in the beautiful city of Casablanca to discuss the political situation between Spain and the Kingdom of Morocco, as the Spanish government had recently pressed the issue of integrating Morocco completely into the Spanish North African Territory. The Moroccan puppet government, while still under severe Vichy and German influence, has been rather staunch in its opposition to this plan and the situation has quickly turned tense with Moroccan parties, which had been previously banned, returning as guerillas against Spanish forces in Casablanca. Spanish officials had thus proposed a meeting in Casablanca to discuss the proposal with the Moroccan authorities, with the Italian delegates as mediator."
twrspain.1.a:0 "Let's see how this pans out"
twrspain.2.t:0 "The Casablana Conference"
twrspain.2.d:0 "With the Moroccan delegations ariving to Casablanca this morning, the conference has begun. The recent issue of Moroccan integration into the Spanish colonial territory has been pressed by the Spanish authorities since December last year. King Mohammed the 5th has been opposed to this policy, regarding it as an unfair treatment of the Moroccan people. During this tense period between the kingdom of Morocco and the Spanish state, anti-Spanish parties have popped up once more and started a guerilla war against the Spanish in the Atlas territory. Their struggle has inspired many Moroccan workers and the king has become seriously anxious of the prospect of liberal revolution in Morocco if he bows to the wims of Spain."
twrspain.2.a:0 "Integration is something we can all aspire to"
twrspain.2.b:0 "Morocco will not become the next Ethiopia"
twrspain.3.t:0 "The Casablanca Conference - Morocco Agrees"
twrspain.3.d:0 "In a display of loyalty and knowing their superiours, the Moroccan delegates have caved in to the demands of the Spanish delegates, allowing Spain to fully absorb the Moroccan aparatus into the colonial territory administration and formally ending years of Moroccan monarchy and sovereign rule. While they have accepted, we should not expect an end to the current guerilla combat with the anti-Spanish parties, as they clearly do not listen to any form of government."
twrspain.3.a:0 "Ah, victory..."
twrspain.4.t:0 "The Casablanca Conference - Morocco Refuses"
twrspain.4.d:0 "Tragic news from Casbalanca, Franco: The Moroccan subjects have refused to acknowledge Spain as their superiour, still rejecting our policy of integrating Morocco into the Spanish Empire, and their delegates have made this rather clear to our Spanish delegates. After an awkward ten seconds of silence, our delegates bombarded the Moroccans with insults, ranging from slightly offensive to clearly racist ones, and stormed out of the room, answering the Spanish press and painting a rather negative picture of Morocco. While this happened, the Italian delegate could not be bothered to intervere."
twrspain.4.a:0 "Why did we even invite a mediator?"
twrspain.5.t:0 "Moroccan Police refuses to give Spain anti-Spanish fighters"
twrspain.5.d:0 "The recent display of disrespect shown by our delegates in Morocco has flared up anti-Spanish sentiment in Morocco. This evening, Moroccan officers met with Spanish authorities regarding the transfer of Moroccan Communist rebels to the Spanish authorities. This meeting quickly turned into a brawl, when the Moroccan officers refused to transfer the criminals, saying that they should be judged by Moroccan law and not Spanish law. This blatant disrespect for Spain was answered by the knuckles of the Spanish men, leaving the officers bruised in their office and causing a national scandal the next day."
twrspain.5.a:0 "We'll teach them respect!"
twrspain.6.t:0 "Moroccan Student Riot"
twrspain.6.d:0 "The recent abuse scandal spread through the Moroccan cities like a wildfire and almost every Moroccan man, woman and child has heard of this case of Spanish violence. As answer to the national scandal, students of the Casablanca university took it to the streets today, disrupting the normal activities and causing a mess. Moroccan policemen refused to actively stop the students, leading to the involvement of the Spanish forces there. The Spanish forces quickly resorted to violence against the students, causing the death of several. The protest, while dispersed, quickly turned even more violent, as students now began to avenge the deaths of their comrades. During these riots, 1 Spanish soldier was mortally wounded after being hit by a brick. Morocco is clearly shaken by this riot and we should not expect peace in Casablanca for a while."
twrspain.6.a:0 "Morocco must be pacified!"
twrspain.7.t:0 "Bolshevik Moroccan Students arrested"
twrspain.7.d:0 "A recent raid terrorised Casablanca university, the same place the recent Moroccan riot began, as Spanish authorities suspected that communist activities were getting a grip on the university. During the raid, a small 80 students were arrested, suspected of bolshevik and jewish activities. The students were detained by Spanish forces, even after protest from the Moroccan government."
twrspain.7.a:0 "One can never be too carefull with the reds"
twrspain.8.t:0 "The Rabat Trial"
twrspain.8.d:0 "The recent arrestation of 80 bolshevik and jewish students of the Casablanca university has become a widespread story in both Spain and Morocco. The trials of these 80 men begun 4 days ago and was broadcasted live by both the Moroccan and Spanish state television. The trials have become a point of anti-Spanish tension in Morocco, as many people believe these students to be innocent of any crimes. The trial ended this evening, with 8 being found innocent, 67 found guilty and going to jail and 5 found guilty and going on deathrow, expected to be executed next sunday."
twrspain.8.a:0 "Let's hope it does not become necessary to repeat those trials"
twrspain.9.t:0 "Mohammed V speeches in Rabat"
twrspain.9.d:0 "After the Rabat Trial 6 days ago, Mohammed the 5th, king of Morocco, has come to the big city of Rabat to comfort the families of the students that were executed. In a now infamous speech, Mohammed denounced the practices of the Spanish government in Morocco, calling it nazi-like and authoritarian. His speech went on for 2 hours and slowly turned into generally anti-Spanish rethoric, as the king raged on about the Spanish authorities, even talking about the secrets discussed in Casablance in January. The shock of the public was, at first, paralyzing, but swiftly turned into anti-Spanish rage. His speech ended  with a last warning, threatening to declare a small jihad against the Spanish crown and its caudillo if Spain would not retreat from the Moroccan territory."
twrspain.9.a:0 "Brave, but foolish, my friend"
twrspain.10.t:0 "The Moroccan Ultimatum"
twrspain.10.d:0 "Madrid is in shock, as a small letter from Casablanca has confirmed the worst fear of caudillo Francisco Franco. The letter demands the Spanish armed forces to retreat from Morocco in 48 hours. The letter threatens a complete jihad against Spain if the demands are not completed and is signed by Mohammed the 5th of Morocco. This disrespect for Spanish authority has enraged the cortes and many hardlining falangist members have become proponents of a military campaign that sweeps through Morocco. However, small elements of the military have sympathised with the Moroccan cause and seem to support the ultimatum."
twrspain.10.a:0 "Morocco needs to learn who's the leader of North Africa"
twrspain.10.b:0 "Follow their demands, Morocco is not worth a fight"
twrspain.11.t:0 "Spain does not listen"
twrspain.11.d:0 "Our ultimatum has been met with nothing but silence from Madrid and has thus forced our hand. The Spanish, unwilling to negotiate as tyrants in their castle, have not followed our demands and the colonial garrison stays in Morocco. The Sultan has already ordered the mobilization of the Moroccan troops, awaiting the official decleration of war drafted by a family member."
twrspain.11.a:0 "Morocco will fight forever!"
twrspain.12.t:0 "The Moroccan Defeat"
twrspain.12.d:0 "After a long and demoralizing campaing through Morocco, the Spanish forces have finally given up. The Moroccan army and rebels were able to repel attack after attack and even captured Ifni and the Rif territory from the Spanish. Voices inside the government have thus been openly denouncing the pointless war and Franco is forced to recognize Moroccan independence."
twrspain.12.a:0 "A real disaster..."
twrspain.13.t:0 "Victory in Africa"
twrspain.13.d:0 "Finally, Spanish boots march throughout the city of Casablanca cementing the authority of Francisco Franco in the region. With the crushing defeat of the Moroccan army, Sultan Mohammed the fifth has been begrudingly forced to accept Spanish demands, ending Moroccan independence from Spain completely and accepting a new Spanish governor in charge of Morocco. The treaty, signed in Ifni, will complete the integration project set up by Franco since the 1940s."
twrspain.13.a:0 "Victory is for the Spanish!"
twrspain.14.t:0 "Napalm Run in Morocco"
twrspain.14.d:0 "With the war in Morocco almost reaching its third month, the military has become impatient and irrational in its ways of fighting. Cries for the war to finally end have begun to grow in Spain itself, even if its still concluded to the intellectual corners of society. However, due to their pressure alone, the Spanish airforce has finally outsourced the fight to napalm. The chemical called napalm is known to be highly flamable and has seen use in several former conflicts, but the news of use of the chemical on Moroccan villages has already spread across Spain with a thunderous shock for most. How can we, the civilizing force of christianity, use such a rotten and devilish substance? Many have started to question the army, but have yet to see the faults in Franco's government."
twrspain.14.a:0 "Turn down the napalm for a month..."
twrspain.15.t:0 "Student Draft-Dodging"
twrspain.15.d:0 "Gonzalez, student at the university of Madrid, ran through the countryside. As a young and fit male, he was forced by the government to fight in the conflict in Africa. However, wishing to once be a great musician, Gonzalez actively dodged the draft, something punishable by jail-time. His escape from the university and the grip of the secret police would be a short victory, as the government would continue to be on his tail. Today, this barn will be his last resort to dodge the draft. His last hope. \n\nWith the continueing war down South, Spanish citizens, mostly studying at university, have began to avoid their mobilization en-masse. These cowards are currently either in jail or hunted by the special secret police, but the growing popularity of draft-dodging has forced to government to expand the police force and even open up a special department against draft-dodging."
twrspain.15.a:0 "Cowards!"

The brewing city of heat and Spanish civilization has seen controversy the likes of it have never stepped foot on this part of Spain. Politicians from around the region have begun singing the same song, complaining about the war, always in a negative tone. Their complaints, ranging from the lenght of the war to the military control of the war, has been annoyingly distrusted by Franco's capital of Madrid. Thus, only a common soldier like me can tell the people about Cueta... \n\nThe first passage of Italian Stefano Della Chiaie's book 'Homage to Ceuta' has become known worlwide among Moroccan war supporters. The recent publishment of the book shows the war in a positive light and perspective from the fascist writer of the book, gloryifing the violence as a showcase of what a civilizing mission should include."

He's a social person with a big group of friends, yet he keeps a secret from them, in fear of the government finding out: he's part of the illegal student movement. The Spanish student movement has its roots in German Europe, most notably in Vichy France, where the new young generation of university students have started to rebel against the authoritarian nature of statehood in Europe. Their anti-authoritarian ideology has been the main basis for Franco and his government to criminalize the student movement in Spain prior to his death. However, as is the nature of underground societies and organisations, the student movement has been rather popular among the regions of Spain. The hotbed of the current movement is Barcelona, filled to the brim with angered Catalan nationalists, republicans and bolsheviks, plotting the demise of Francoist Spain. While the secret service of Spain is currently doing a rather clean job of surpressing it, we cannot surpress the movement forever."

After bursting through the door of a local student club, which was suspected to house anti-Spanish activists, Barcelona policemen shot the 19 year old Juan, suspecting him to flee the scene. The shot instantly killed him, according to later medical reports, hitting a vital piece of the heart. The death of the young student has been mourned across Spain by Francoists and anti-Francoists alike and has sparked public debate on the roll of the regional police departments. The fact that the kid was a Catalan activist has also destabilized the region, with many students currently rioting in the city against the government."

However, after an hour of battle and beatings, the protest did not want to split apart. Thus, the use of tear gas was eventually authorized by the ministry. While the gas helped for a moment, the protests clearly did not react well with this decision and quickly turned violent. With the outbreak of riots in Madrid, the government swiftly fortified parliament, hoping that the riot would end later. The fortification of parliament has been 10 hours ago now, and the riots have yet to die down."

Blanco's decision to declare the state has been one of controversy among the party members and his position as Caudillo might be on the line for it. General Emilio Esteban-Infantes, the current chief of staff of the army, has been the most vocal proponent of declaring a state of emergency and is currently tasked with ending the riots in Madrid."

His death quickly spread panic, but the military police was eventually able to detain the suspect. The French man of average height was seen carrying around a SVT-40, a Soviet semi-automatic rifle produced during Operation Barbarossa and still used by underground partisans sponsored by the now ailing Soviet Union. His trial will be on a later date. For the moment, Luis Carrero Blanco has been appointed Caudillo of Spain by Franco's will and the Cortes."

Harassment towards the police has made the region around the parliament a no-go zone for the police corps. Blanco, heavily frustated and, according to some close friends, on the brink of crying, has finally given up.

A group of these survivors, under the leadership of the former Republican government, decided to form a government in exile, contesting the legitimacy of the Spanish state. While they've been next to useless against Franco's regime since the 1940s, their presence still cements republicanism in Spain as a solid ideology. Thus, the Spanish parliament has decided to meet with the exiles in Madrid and welcome them back to Spain and its political landscape, adopting their flag in the process to represent a true Third Republic."

Many elements and members of the liberal and socialist parties have already fled the city of Madrid, as its in the iron grasp of Piñar and de Santiago.

Instead, the capital of the Spanish Republic experiences something completely else, a force unknown to nature: ideological tension. While violence has shortly been surpressed with the victory of the NLC, the council has also started to isolate itself from the public eye, perhaps for preperations. The current social climate has thus become tense: Socialists and former Falangists share a hatred for eachother and there seems little to stop them going at it, with only the haunting ghost of communist pressure keeping the streets of Madrid empty. \n\nLooking through the window, you see only one policeman walking down the street."

'Could we possibly enjoy a cup of tea while we're here? we only want to ask some questions, nothing more', the shorter policeman asks. The man nods. \n\nAfter a long tea break, the 2 policemen finally leave the house. 'We're looking forward to meeting you again, señor!', they say and leave the house.

Without really thinking about it, Erica began about her family: 'Well, my family lives outside Valencia, owning a big plot of land for the cattle. The plot of land was given several years ago for grandpa's deeds during 1937.' \n\nAfter saying that, Erica notices that the teacher tenses up. The whole class quietly looks at her. 20 seconds passes till rumours start to be exchanged across the floor. 'Perhaps her grandpa worked with Franco', 'He could have been a traitor to the republic', 'Most likely helped the carlist party in Valencia!'

His speech applauded the student movement's actions and highlighted the recent events surrounding the death of Enrique Galván, former moderate revolutionary and opposition leader against Sabaté's military wing, as a lucky break for the party, denouncing his moderate stance as a 'threat to Spanish marxism as we know it'. His speech was brief, yet it has clearly cemented the new feeling Spain is now associated with: A feeling not unlike the Soviet Union under the great Joseph Stalin. The final hours of the congress were spend mostly on reorganizing the new bureaucracy of Spain, ending with the decision to allow the post of First Chairman, held by Sabaté, more power on the judicial system."

The Red Brigades of Sabaté parade through the major cities of Spain, a clear sign of things to come for the poor people of Spain. With this, Sabaté finally felt the need to formalize the former student movement into more of a party. Thus, he has proposed the formation of the Young Blood Socialist Party (Spanish: Sangre Joven Partido Socialista). The ranks of the party are currently mostly filled with young, fanatical veterans of the Red Wind Period, ready to change Spain to their perfect image for their great leader. While this may seem rather great for Sabaté, the formation of the party has also clearly shown many old members of the movement the true face of Sabaté, comparing him to the former Joseph Stalin in his approaches. Thus, a large chunk of the former student and union base has been lost to the more anarchist and liberal parties still present in Spain."

Franco, who has clearly lost a lot of energy during this past couple of weeks, explained the current situation of the Spanish retreat from Morocco, finally acknowledging his defeat in the conflict. However, cunning as Franco is, he has not acknowledged it as his failure, but that of his high command and a lack of coordination. After this twist, Franco continued to explain his plans for the future of Spain without its crown colony: a complete political reformation of the bureaucracy and government, as to turn it into a less divided and more efficient machine. Mixed reactions plagued the crowd, as nobody really knew what Franco meant with this."

However, despite all of this, Francisco Franco has finally dismissed his entire high command today, citing their failure in the Moroccan campaign as unacceptable. Anger now stirs these same officers. The fear is not completely gone, but anger has taken its place for the most part. Franco's incompetence during the war had cost us Morocco, yet the high command has been blamed for his mistake.

Franco, clearly not flattered by this remark and inspired by his old ministers, kept pushing for the final reform of abandoning the theory and officially ended falangist theorem in the ministry this morning. The news spread quickly across Madrid and, within hours, the Falangist youth, womens and paramilitary branches had gathered around the palace. Armed to the teeth, these men and women saw to harm Franco and his followers and, thus, the military was called upon for backup. Intimidated by this display of power, the falangist rebels broke into smaller groups and terrorized the streets of Madrid for 6 hours, killing 27 Spaniards (of which 24 Jewish) and 16 foreigners. The rebellion ended with the arrest of Hedilla in A Coruña, forcing the rest of the falangist hierarchy to give up.

The followers of Hedilla have clearly taken an anti-government stance on the issue, fighting for the inclusion of the national-syndicalist rethoric inherint to the falangist movement. On the other hand, the more traditionalist members of the Falange have chosen Franco's side, rejecting Hedilla's teachings as bolshevik and seeing him as a threat to the national security. With this issue, the party has split apart into the conservative Falange National Movement and the National Syndicalist Attack Junta led by Hedilla.

Only half of the 47,000 men survived the conflict and now live in Spain, shellshocked by the brutality of the Eastern Front compared to any other front seen at that point. The brutality of both the barbarians of the German SS, as well as the fanatic suicidal tendencies of the Soviet troops has scarred many of the former Blue Division and they now live in absolute poverty, unable to properly function in our society. \n\nThe Falangist elements of the Movement have made recently reignited the debate on the issue of compensating these 'heroes of Spain' financially. Their proposal is often met with harsh criticism from all sides, regarding the fact that many men were volunteers and that they didn't even serve Spain in any conflict.

The festival will showcase several foreign films to the Spanish public of San Sebastián, with the goal to energize the city and its culture once more. Due to the official support of the government and the possibility of being internationally recognized by the IFAMPP has led to little to no censorship regarding the films, though only Spanish movies are able to win awards during the festival. \n\nGreat Movies such as Don Camilo, House of Wax, The war of God and Mission in Buenos Aires will be shown during the week and several personalities from across the globe will attend the festival, such as Yoshiko Yamaguchi, Tilda Thamar and Jacqueline Naves.

However, this bastion has become a controversial point, as Spanish diplomats have aggressively pushed for its return to Madrid. They view Gibraltar as the ultimate humiliation of Spain and seek to turn back time. Yesterday, Blas Piñar, the new president of Spain after the Búnker couped the old democratic government, has declared an end to Anglo-American dominance in Iberia. The ultimate sign of our influence, in his opinion, isn't the English media, literature or songs, but the territory of Gibraltar, as it's an integral part to the continued existance of English dominance in Africa and the Mediterannean. Pinar has now demanded the return of the region and is not afraid to use force against any sign of hostility."

While the PTL is expected to win, a major power has entered Spain with the end of Blanco: The revolutionary FELN. FELN has been formed between old clandestine communist and anarchist groups that fought against Franco during his government and have become a threat to the liberal transition for many, including the PCE. While both agree on marxist theory, the FELN is seen by the PCE as too radical and revolutionary for Spain during this period of transition.

Iria has not hold back on the issue of autonomy, as he smoothly threatens the central government with Catalan independence if the government ever deminishes the liberties and priviliges of the Catalan people and government.

Despite the best effort of Galván, del Vayo was able to expand his control inside the party after the Viento Rojo period, cementing himself as the next chairman. With this, the party has finally chosen Julio Álvarez del Vayo as the new leader of the FELN. Del Vayo has swiftly taken it upon himself to give his paramilitary supporters an use, arresting the lesser members of the PSOE and the democratic socialist branch of the party.

While a vital part of life, the church and its clergy has too much power for any progressive government and should thus be stripped from some of its priveliges. Their collaboration with the old Francoist regime also has put them into an unfavourable position in Spain, as many clergy members continue to hold right-wing political views opposing the agenda of FELN. While Del Vayo's faction has been in favour of harsh measures against the clergy, Galván has tried to sow sympathy across the party for the clergy, as they are victims of propaganda and thus more a symptom than the actual cancer in Spanish society."

Nationalism is seen by many inside FELN as a tool of the populist elite, trying to use the people against the same people they claim to represent, causing silly wars with nobody winning anything and the proletariat losing everything. However, nationalism also touched Spain in the early 19th century and movements such as the Basque and Catalan movements were inspired by this nationalist rethoric. While del Vayo has been sceptic of the Catalans and their intentions, Galván has celebrated Catalan and Basque culture as a culture of fighters for democracy and socialism, referencing their efforts against Francoism in the past."

While the entire FELN party can only praise their efforts against fascism and the sacrifices they had to make, del Vayo fears the growing power of the universities inside Spain, accusing it of expanding urban culture and influence to the poor people of the countryside, who, in his eyes, are the real heroes of socialism due to their unwavering resistance against Franco since the end of 1939 in unorganized militias. Galván, on the other hand, has accused del Vayo of picking sides when there isn't a conflict, trying to play the students against the rural population in an effort to expand his own grip on Spanish society."

During the Spanish conflict of 1936, thousands of anarchists armed themselves, fighting against the enemies of democracy and socialism in Spain. Their effort was without a doubt a true inspiration for the later students and their coup against the old traditional order of Franco and Blanco. However, with the return of democracy, anarchists have become a danger to stability, according to del Vayo and his supporters. While del Vayo is in favour of demilitarizing the anarchists in Spain, especially in the autonomous community of Catalonia, Galván has criticized del Vayo for his anti-libertarian stance, accusing him of authoritarian measures and comparing him to the old Soviet dictator, Joseph Stalin, and his great purge."

While the Internationale is currently in a rough shape after the failure of the Soviet Union to keep the Germans from Moscow, marxism continues to spread across the globe, with or without foreign support. Del Vayo's faction has thus adopted a policy of 'Socialism, only in Spain', in which Spain has to isolate itself from the European continent and grow its socialist government through interior decisions. Galván has, once again, seen the similarities between del Vayo's agenda and the old Soviet policy of 'Socialism in One Country' and has loudly criticized del Vayo for his betrayal to the international proletariat, using Marx's Das Kapital as proof."

Known by many as the Iberian Pact, it was made in the final periods of the Civil War, but has survived long past it and became an increasingly important force, as their joint might becomes a serious guarantee."
twrspanews.10.a:0 "A possible rival to Italy?"

twrspanews.11.t:0 "Dissolution of the Iberian Pact"
twrspanews.11.d:0 "Shocking news from Madrid and Lisbon have confirmed the official dissolution of the Iberian Pact. Signed in 1939 during the last stage of the Spanish Civil War, the Iberian Pact was a pact of mutual defence between Portugal and Spain in the event of foreign intervention disturbing the balance in Iberia. However, it recently fell into a downwards spiral of vetoed reforms, preventing it from progressing.\n\nThe clearly angered Spanish Government and Portuguese Government have thus decided to formally disband the pact and end all joint operations, in the hopes of finally bringing diplomatic peace between the nations and ending the burden that the pact brought."
twrspanews.11.a:0 "Interesting"
twrspanews.11.b:0 "Ciao, Portugal!"

twrspanews.13.t:0 "Completion of the Gran Fuerte"
twrspanews.13.d:0 "After several months of hard work and millions of pesetas spent, Spain has finally announced the completion of its greatest project: a military masterpiece of connected fortifications lining Spain's Atlantic Coast, featuring the most modern pieces of artillery and infrastructure in Europe.\n\nWhile this "wall" may have been inspired by the Atlantikwall, many experts boldly said that the Spanish 'Gran Fuerte' is superiour compared to the currently decaying Atlantikwall. While corruption and money shortages have left some holes in the current project, few can deny that the 'Gran Fuerte' is a great showcase of modern military engineering. Spain has already planned a celebration regarding the completion of this project."
twrspanews.13.a:0 "Mighty fine wall, Spain!"
twrspanews.13.b:0 "Spain is safe now!"

twrspanews.14.t:0 "The Spanish-Moroccan Conflict"
twrspanews.14.d:0 "The failure of the Cassablance Conference and the ensuing trials held by the Pro-Spanish court has lit the fire of independence in Morocco, as many men take it to the streets to resist.\nSpain and Morocco had been growing distant over the past months, as failed diplomatcies that tried to integrate Morocco only led to insults and injuries. This divide became even wider after Spanish Authorities apprehended several Moroccan Bolsheviks, their trials pushed the King of Morocco, Mohammed V, to appease the Moroccans in a controversial way, promising an end to Spanish influence. His words were swiftly countered by the Spanish, demanding an end to his advocating of independence. Mohammed V, urged by a Pro-Independence court, declared independence, igniting a conflict between Morocco and Spain."

twrspanews.15.d:0 "Francisco Franco has been facing a regional conflict in the Basque territories, as the French-backed ETA becomes a dominant group in the region. From the French Basque region, regular ETA incursions have crossed into the Spanish borders, Basque terrorism has become a frequent event in the Basque region, as car bombings and assassinations have become the driving force behind the ETA's agenda. The ETA had already shown its competence by killing Luis Carrero Blanco in a car bombing incident, but Blanco's assassination has been nothing compared to their recent campaign against Franco himself.\n\nThis morning, on a trip to the Aragonese city of Zaragoza, Franco's car exploded the moment when it entered the city. With Francisco Franco blown to bits. The National Movement is utterly decimated."
twrspanews.15.a:0 "Another one bites the dust."
twrspanews.15.b:0 "My God..."
twrspanews.16.t:0 "Basque Independence"
twrspanews.16.d:0 "With the rise of the FELN government in Madrid, the borders of Spain are unstable as ever. The historically unstable region of Navarre follows the trend of opposing the freshly elected government in Madrid, resulting in the Basque Government's Declaration of Independence. The FELN government, angered by such insolence by the National Basque Party and the Basque Government, are currently preparing to restore order by force. However, the task of putting the revolt down seems almost impossible for the paralyzed government, as thousands of nationalists have joined the cause of the Basque in their armed struggle.\n\nStability in Spain continues to rapidly deteriorate."
twrspanews.16.a:0 "Who would win? Spain or some angry nationalists?"
twrspanews.16.b:0 "They won't last long!"
twrspanews.17.t:0 "End of the Gibraltar Crisis"
twrspanews.17.d:0 "After a long and tense standoff between the Spanish army and the British, Spain has finally backed down, granting a relief for the world.\n\nThe issue of Gibraltar has always been sour during the Franco Regime. While Franco's regime wasn't keen on violating British control in the region, warhawks inside the old cabinet weren't as cautious as Franco. With the fall of Franco and the late coup d'état of the Fascist Búnker Group, the Gibraltar Question flared up once again. Blas Piñar and his comrades in the army have had their eyes set on the rock since the start of their government, with the mobilization of troops starting the Gibraltar Crisis. An ultimatum followed the crisis, which the British refused. But, the prospect of an invasion led to Spain's decision to back down, saving Iberia from total disaster."
twrspanews.17.a:0 "At least nobody died."
twrspanews.17.b:0 "A failure for Spain..."
twrspanews.17.c:0 "We stay on the rock!"
twrspanews.18.t:0 "The Invasion of Gibraltar"
twrspanews.18.d:0 "Europe sits on the edge of a knife once again, with the Spanish Army marching into Gibraltar.\n\nGibraltar has always been a painful topic for British and Spanish relations, but the recent Búnker Coup in Spain led to a new passion regarding Gibraltar. Under Blas Piñar, the new Fascist government adopted a more aggresive tone in policies, treating Gibraltar as core Spanish territory that would return to Madrid before the end of the decade. While few actively took these words serious, the recent mobilization near Gibraltar quickly gave those fighting words teeth, turning the situation into a serious crisis. The ultimatum sent by Spain was refused by the British, leading to the invasion of Gibraltar. Spain is now at war with the British Empire, many believing that the Búnker Government's days are numbered."
twrspanews.18.a:0 "Stability and Spain don't mix..."
twrspanews.18.b:0 "We'll take Gibraltar before Christmas!"
twrspanews.18.c:0 "The Spanish won't even know what hit them."
twrspanews.19.t:0 "Del Vayo Seizes Power"
twrspanews.19.desc:0 "Spanish history has many quirks to it, which few nations may share. But one of the most common trope in Spanish history, however, is also quite normal in everywhere else - Dictators. Today, Spain once again experiences the sour corner of history, as Del Vayo of the Agrarian-Stalinist FELN Faction seizes power.\n\nThe FELN has been divided since its inception, with del Vayo being one of the major figures inside the party opposing the more Democratic students that have recently joined the party. The recent victory of FELN in Spain led to the eventual increase in del Vayo's popularity and, with support, del Vayo was able to seize control. In a now infamous radio speech, del Vayo promises the return of Socialism in Spain, one worthy of the admiration of the Soviet Union and the rest of the globe."
twrspanews.19.a:0 "Surprising."
twrspanews.19.b:0 "Comrade del Vayo knows best!"

moroccan_spanish_war_desc:0 "The Moroccan people have finally stood up against the western, catholic oppresors reigning from their ivory towers in Madrid. The Spanish have never kept their promises and have shown that they're not to be trusted. Thus, the Moroccan government under our Sultan has finally broken the chains keeping us tight to Spain."
gibraltar_integration:0 "Integration of Gibraltar"
gibraltar_integration_desc:0 "The region of Gibraltar has been seperated from Madrid ever since the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, having to stay under the British boot. The region today, however, has mixed with anglo culture and our recent occupation of the region has been troublesome, as the government has seriously underestimated the level of British integration Gibraltar has experienced. Thus, it has become a major duty for us to return Gibraltar to its former, Spanish self."
SPA_introduce_the_peseta:0 "Introduce the Spanish Peseta"
SPA_introduce_the_peseta_desc:0 "Gibraltar under the British had always been economically autonomous. While tied to London in several ways, Gibraltar used its own pound system, thought pegged to the British pound sterling. This currency makes economic integration into Spain a serious problem, as the Spanish currency still has to catch up to the British pound in terms of power. Thus, a forced introduction of the Peseta in Gibraltar will help economic integration iniatives, even if it threatens local stability."
SPA_surpress_yanito:0 "Surpress Yanito Dialect"
SPA_surpress_yanito_desc:0 "Yanito, also known as Llanito, is a heavy Andalusian dialect with strong British characteristics, mostly spoken around the Gibraltar region. This dialect, just like most other Spanish fringe dialects, has threatened serious integration based on culture, local traditionalism and bureaucratic efficiency, as many documents left by the former Gibraltar government are in either British english or Yanito Spanish, making it difficult to decipher for our superiour Castillian administrators. Thus, an extensive project to promote Castillian Spanish and surpress Yanito Andalusian has been proposed by the Caudillo."
SPA_deport_religious_minorities:0 "End Anglican Protestant Influence"
SPA_deport_religious_minorities_desc:0 "Due to the heavy grip of the British since the 1600s, the former catholic stronghold of Gibraltar has experienced English protestantism for almost 300 years. Such a heretical belief cannot be allowed inside our catholic and holy state and allowing them to stay could only increase the difficulty of integrating Gibraltar into Spain."

During the Second World War, 70% of the population worked at the local dockyards of Gibraltar, supplying the British Empire in the Mediterranean Sea in several instances, such as during the seige of Malta. To this day, while the dockyards aren't as busy as they once were, they still house amazing potential for us and the Gibraltar working force."

Every month, officials from both nations meet in the city of Ponferrada (Thus leading to the nickname \"Ponferrada Pact\"), discussing the latest information regarding world politics and Iberia.
