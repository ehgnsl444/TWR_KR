finland.1.t:0 "The Situation of Finland"
finland.1.d:0 "Finland in 1952 looks back to her glorious recent history, while facing an uncertain future. She has survived her wars unwavering, and the dream of a greater Finland is now a reality, liberating Karelia with the help of her German brothers-in-arms. But the new Europe is a dark place, and the Finnish society will surely go through unseen shifts as the situation of the world develops around us once more; and our own humble nation of the north might just get caught up in it all."
finland.1.a:0 "Pro Patria!"

finland.2.t:0 "Presidential Election of 1952"
finland.2.d:0 "The presidential election of 1952 is the most exciting presidential election in years. The 1946 election was a landslide as the popular incumbent Risto Ryti successfully defeated Juho Kusti Paasikivi, winning the electors of nearly most parties, all wanting to maintain the status quo and the stability of the Ryti years. However, Ryti is uninterested for a third six-years term due to his declining health, thus a new president will have to be elected. Four parties have pushed for their respective candidates; The Progressive Party pushed for the American Educated Irma Karvikko, the heir apparent of the Progressives. Secondly, the Social Democrats with veteran politician and three-time prime minister Juho Paasikivi, the Agrarian Union with their peoples' man Urho Kekkonen, and the black sheep; officer and fascist Paavo Susitaival of the Patriotic Peoples' Front. \n\nHowever, due to the nature of the electoral system, only two candidates will have a real chance of winning. These will be..."

finland.2.b:0 "Karvikko against Kekkonen!"
finland.2.c:0 "Susitaival against Kekkonen!"
finland.2.e:0 "Kekkonen against Paasikivi!"

finland.3.t:0 "Economic Policy Debate"
finland.3.d:0 "For decades, Finland's main production came from the agricultural sector. But as the rest of the world is modernising, a question became more and more apparent for the establishment - should Finland attempt to modernise or maintain its traditional roots?"
finland.3.a:0 "Agriculture is our strength!"
finland.3.b:0 "We will have to modernise to survive!"

finland.4.t:0 "Karelia Policy"
finland.4.d:0 "Debates have been sparked over our decisions around the land we have conquered from the Russians; East Karelia and it's troublesome demographics. How should the next administration handle this territory?"
finland.4.a:0 "Karelia must be Finnish!"
finland.4.b:0 "We must remain humane."

finland.5.t:0 "Foreign Policy Debate"
finland.5.d:0 "Since the victory of Greater Finland, our foreign policies have been dominated by Germany, with all flavours of foreign policies relating to Germany in one way or another.\n\nBut our long existing policy in appeasing Germany has isolated us from the rest of the world, and it might be the next administration's task to finally determine a policy regarding this specific issue."
finland.5.a:0 "Germany is our greatest ally."
finland.5.b:0 "Germany must not be trusted."
finland.5.c:0 "We have to distance from Germany."

finland.6.t:0 "Internal Politics"
finland.6.d:0 "Due to the fact that the president has ruled for 12 years straight, some politicians have grew the nerve to suggest Finland would fare better under a different political model, with some secretly calling Finland a semi-dictatorship. What is the chamber's majority opinion?"
finland.6.a:0 "Finland is a Democracy!"
finland.6.b:0 "A strong leader is needed too!"

finland.7.t:0 "Direction of the Military"
finland.7.d:0 "Figures in the Officer Corps have approached prominent politicians of neutral parties, asking them to consider military issues when choosing a candinate."
finland.7.a:0 "Active defense got us through the Winter War."
finland.7.b:0 "To truly be victorious, you must attack."

finland.8.t:0 "Election Night"
finland.8.d:0 "The votes are going in, as the first phase concluded, the electors looked to the results and have casted their votes..."
finland.8.a:0 "Victory goes to..."

finland.10.t:0 "President Susitaival"
finland.10.d:0 "In the greatest political upset of Finnish history, Paavo Susitaival has secured the Finnish presidency. A known fascist and a former soldier, Susitaival became Finland's first openly fascist president.\n\nIn his first speech to the parliament, Susitaival thanked his supporters, promising to maintain the great Finnish nation and bring her to new heights. As the members applauded, the social democrats and the western liberals are concerned, fearing that Finnish democracy has come to an end."
finland.10.a:0 "A new face."

finland.11.t:0 "President Kekkonen"
finland.11.d:0 "Representing the growing conservative class, Urho Kaleva Kekkonen of the Agrarians have secured the Finnish presidency.\n\nIn his victory speech, Kekkonen promised to bring economic prosperity and maintaining the great peace. While he made great remarks on the previous leadership, he stated that as the former party has ruled for almost 15 years, it is time for the Agrarians to once again demonstrate their political capabilities on the presidential level."
finland.11.a:0 "Kekkonen is here!"

finland.12.t:0 "President Paasikivi"
finland.12.d:0 "An experienced politician, an esteemed Social Democrat and a former prime minister, Juho Kusti Paasikivi has finally secured the Finnish presidency, ending the 15 years reign of the Progressive Party.\n\nBeing elected in his 80s, Paasikivi's reign is uncertain, as his health is being questioned by his oppositions. Regardless, the Finnish people will now welcome a change in leadership, and perhaps a change in the general approach towards different policies."
finland.12.a:0 "The old man's final hurrah."

finland.13.t:0 "President Karvikko"
finland.13.d:0 "Regarded as Risto's successor, Irma Helena Karvikko is an interesting figure with his drastically different views on diplomacy. Running on a platform of re-entering the international community, Karvikko has secured the Finnish presidency.\n\nBeing Finland's first ever female president, Karvikko will now continue the Progressive Party's presidential supremacy for six more years, promising to reform the Republic into a modern and peaceful power of Northern Europe."
finland.13.a:0 "How exciting."

finland.14.t:0 "Fenno-Swedes Oppose Language Policy"
finland.14.d:0 "The recent act to revoke the Swedish language as a national language in Finland has not been well received by the Swedish-speaking population. Already, protest marches are being organized in cities such as Vaasa, with an address being written calling for the cancellation of this policy."
finland.14.a:0 "They can cry all they want."
finland.14.b:0 "And how does this concern us..?"
finland.14.c:0 "Condemn this!"

finland.15.t:0 "SSP Capitalises on Language Problem"
finland.15.d:0 "The SSP/RSP or Swedish Social Party, which is the hardline Swedish-speakers party in Finland has capitalised on the debate surrounding the controversial language law. As its support has spiked due to the recent political upsets."
finland.15.a:0 "They are not a threat."

finland.16.t:0 "Sweden Condemns 'Inhumane' Language Law"
finland.16.d:0 "The Swedish govenrment has issued an official condemnation on our policy to remove the special status of Swedish. We will of course ignore such provocation."
finland.16.a:0 "None of their concerns."

finland.17.t:0 "Swedish Speakers' General Strike"
finland.17.d:0 "This was an event that we saw coming. Angered by our policies, most Swedish-speaking workers and even some higher ups have organized a general strike. Unlike normal strikers, however, their aim is not to get better wages, but to reinstiate Swedish as a national language, and they claim to be prepared to go 'as far as we need to'."
finland.17.a:0 "We will not change our mind."

finland.18.t:0 "Strike Are Over"
finland.18.d:0 "The strikers have ended their futile protests after waves of crack downs and legislatures, forcing the workers to get back to work."
finland.18.a:0 "Wonderful."

finland.19.t:0 "Finland Denounces the [Root.GetAdjective] Government."
finland.19.d:0 "In a speech yesterday, while speaking about foreign affairs, Finnish President [FIN.GetLeader] called our country as a \"corrupt and inneficient country with a ineffective form of government\". Our foreign ministry has issued a strong protest against such nonsensical claims."
finland.19.a:0 "Are they insane?"

finland.20.t:0 "Finland Seeks Stronger Ties"
finland.20.d:0 "Finnish diplomats have arrived in Germania, bringing us only compliments. They talk about how the \"Finno-German roots run deep\" and seek to establish trade deals with lucrative friendship programs."
finland.20.a:0 "Cool."

finland.30.t:0 "Organizing a Coup"
finland.30.d:0 "We need to act. Forces from within and without are trying to destabilise Europe, and ruin the order that Germany and Finland have established through Europe. In a few weeks time, the old corrupted government will be no more, and Greater Finland will enjoy the sweet embrace of fascism."
finland.30.a:0 "Start training the Sinimustat."

finland.31.t:0 "The Plan in Danger?"
finland.31.d:0 "Rumours have spread within the ranks about how our plans have gotten out, to cadets of the military, through a whistleblower. Some party members are suggesting that we should bribe the cadets, to keep them silent."
finland.31.a:0 "Rumours are rumours."
finland.31.b:0 "Approach the cadets..."

finland.32.t:0 "Night of the Cudgels"
finland.32.d:0 "As evening closes in, members of parliament and other government workers start preparing to leave for the night.\n\nLittle did they know that in the shadows, the Sinimustat are preparing for a lightning-fast takeover of Helsinki to secure power. There are however many ideas on what strategy we should take..."
finland.32.a:0 "Storm government buildings and seize power."
finland.32.b:0 "Lay siege to the parliament house."
finland.32.c:0 "Infiltrate the parliament house and act."

finland.33.t:0 "Dawn"
finland.33.d:0 "The coup was succesful! We have seized power, and though there are news of unrest all acriss the nation, we need to fear not, for a new era has begun for Finland."
finland.33.a:0 "As my first act..."

finland.35.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Declares Greater Finnish State"
finland.35.d:0 "Finland spans larger than ever. The kin in Karelia, the tribes of Onega have been freed, and the three isthmuses lie in our hands. The dream of a Greater Finland has finally been realised, and we will make it even more glorious than it already is!"
finland.35.a:0 "Vapaa, Vakaa, Vankka!"

finland.34.t:0 "Fighting Erupts!"
finland.34.d:0 "Things have not gone to plan. Fighting has broken out between members of the guard jägers, and our Sinimustat, with reinforcements on their way. The situation appears grim..."
finland.34.a:0 "Order a retreat!"

finland.36.t:0 "Dawn"
finland.36.d:0 "Citizens of Helsinki are waking up to surprising news; the fight in Helsinki is over, with the Sinimustat and other fascists having escaped the city. The parliament has been left in a power-vaccuum, with the military swarming around trying to keep order. The coup attempt is over, but the danger is not."
finland.36.a:0 "Defense forces step in!"
finland.36.b:0 "Snap parliamentary and presidential elections!"

finland.37.t_1:0 "IKL Members Flees Helsinki"
finland.37.t_2:0 "IKL Members Abdicate and Leave"
finland.37.d_1:0 "Members of the IKL party, both in parliament and elsewhere, have simultaneously dissapeared. Helsinki is in lockdown, but it seems as if most of the treasonous bunch are getting away."
finland.37.a:0 "Suspicious..."
finland.37.b:0 "Find them and arrest them."

finland.38.t:0 "Fascists Organizing"
finland.38.d:0 "Rumours have spread of a wing of fascists, that have been organizing, hosting camps and gathering support in the countryside. This is worrying our political experts, some who recall the Mäntsälä Rebellion which ended the old Lapua movement."
finland.38.a:0 "Worrying."

finland.39.t:0 "Weapons Caches?"
finland.39.d:0 "A worried farmer in Pohjanmaa has reported finding a huge cache of older rifles and submachine-guns in a nearby state-owned building. Could this be part of something bigger?"
finland.39.a:0 "Likely."

finland.40.t:0 "Threat of War"
finland.40.d:0 "The signs are there; the population seems to be growing more divided every day, and suspicious movements in the north have been overlooked for too long. War is looming."
finland.40.a:0 "We will see."

finland.41.t:0 "Fascist Bases Sweeped"
finland.41.d:0 "ValPo has won in Pohjanmaa; bases of the fascists that have been organizing there have been raided, and numerous members of the movement arrested. Is this the winning blow?"
finland.41.a:0 "Good news?"

finland.42.t:0 "IKL Leaders Arrested"
finland.42.d:0 "The hunt has been succesful, and several high-ranking politicians that we lost contact of a while ago have now been found and turned in. This will hurt the fascists."

finland.43.t:0 "The Danger is Over"
finland.43.d:0 "We have been succesful at protecting this country from the threat of fascism. We can finally stand down."
finland.43.a:0 "Wonderful."

finland.44.t:0 "Kurikka Rebellion"
finland.44.d:0 "The fascists have finally acted. Militias that started moving from the town of Kurikka have declared most of Pohjanmaa and Lappi as a fascist state, and some of our army divisions have defected to their side. We are at war."
finland.44.a:0 "Crush the traitors!"

finland.45.t:0 "The Rebellion is Crushed!"

finland.46.t:0 "The War is Won!"

finland.47.t:0 "Finnish State Visit"
finland.47.d:0 "The Finnish President has made an official state visit to Italy. In this state visit, the Finns showed their good-will to the Italian Government, promising a close relationship despite the lack of any meaningful treaties signed.\n\nThe Finns are clearly trying to stay neutral in terms of European affairs."
finland.47.a:0 "Huh."

finland.48.t:0 "Finnish Proposal"
finland.48.d:0 "From Helsinki to Germania, the Social Democrats of Finland has reached out to our Reich, seeking a mutual beneficial relationship. Attempting to secure their independence in such a turbulent region, Finland wishes to sign a friendly treaty with Germany, making sure that Germany would not attack Finland in any situation. In exchange, Finland has offered us military acceess and favourable trade deals."
finland.48.a:0 "Agree to the deal!"
finland.48.b:0 "Reject the deal!"

finland.49.t:0 "Germany Accepts!"
finland.49.d:0 "Germany has accepted to our deal, Finland has successfully secured it's spot as an independent nation in Europe without the threat of an invasion!"
finland.49.a:0 "Rejoice!"

finland.50.t:0 "Germany Refuses"
finland.50.d:0 "Germany has declined our deal, citing that they respectfully disagree with our terms. They have state that Germany will not seek a partnership with Finland for now."
finland.50.a:0 "Shame."

finland.51.t:0 "Finno-German Treaty"
finland.51.d:0 "Surprisingly, the last bastion of European Democracy and the world's most hated regime signed a mutual assistance treaty. Allowing German access to Finnish strategic spaces, while the Republic of Finland has conducted something that one might describe as below moral standards, the Finnish regime has declared that this act is merely Finland's struggles at preserving it's sovereignty, avoiding any threats of an invasion.\n\nWhile Finland held to the beliefs that all of these actions are performed in the name of Finnish Neutrality, experts in the West are raising their doubts, calling the Finnish Government as too 'Pro-German'."
finland.51.a:0 "An interesting pair..."
finland.51.b:0 "A beautiful relationship!"

finland.52.t:0 "Finnish Communist Ban Lifted"
finland.52.d:0 "In true democratic fashion, the ban on the SKP has been lifted. While this has damaged Europe's relationship with Finland, the Social Democratic Party in charge of Finland seems to be willing to suffer this hit for the sake of political balance between the right and left.\n\nMeanwhile in the West, reception of this event seems to be minor, with some praising Finland as a prime example of how a true democracy should function, allowing opposition parties to have a legal voice in the political system.\n\nInternally, the unbanning of SKP is regarded as a controversial decision, with nationalistic citizens protesting the government's actions, calling this act as traitorous, betraying Finland by allowing the 'Bolsheviks' to operate legally."
finland.52.a:0 "It's a good thing!"
finland.52.b:0 "Oh."

finland.53.t:0 "[From.GetName] Demands Estonia"
finland.53.d:0 "We've received an envoy from [From.GetName]. Our neighbors to the north have a demand to make as it seems. They have demanded from us to cede Estonia, as they see it a rightful Finnish territory, speaking the same language, sharing similar traditions and a Nordic identity. If we refuse, they have promised to take action over our refusal to comply. What shall we do?"
finland.53.a:0 "Cede it, its useless anyways"
finland.53.b:0 "We will not give anything to the Finns!"

finland.54.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts our Demands"
finland.54.d:0 "Our envoy arrived back from the south, bringing [From.GetName] answer to our demand, rushing into the Minister of Diplomacy's officer with a warm smile on his face: They have accepted! We are at last united with our Estonian brothers! May our Nordic brotherhood live on and prosper, under the blue cross!"
finland.54.a:0 "Long live united Finland!"

finland.55.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses our Demands"
finland.55.d:0 "Our envoy arrived back from the south, bringing news from [From.GetName]. Mainly, their answer to our demand to cede Estonia. The envoy enters the Minister of Diplomacy's  with a numb and serious face, presenting us with the answer. They have refused. We have been refused and insulted!"
finland.55.a:0 "One way or another, Estonia will be ours!"

finland.56.t:0 "[From.GetName] Asks to Join"
finland.56.d:0 "An envoy has arrived from our Nordic ally of Finland, an ally during the invasion of The USSR, cooperative with us to this day. It seems as they wish to make our cooperation official, by joining our faction '[GER.GetFactionName]' , seeking closer military, economic and political cooperation in the future. Whenever they'll enter or not is entirely up for us to decide."
finland.56.a:0 "Accept them in, they've proven their loyalty before!"
finland.56.b:0 "Refuse the request, we don't need another liability!"

finland.57.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts"
finland.57.d:0 "We've received a message from our ambassador in Germania, carrying the answer for our request to join the [GER.GetFactionName]- The Reich accepts! The Germans were eager to let us in, as they view us a loyal ally. This will only bring forth a new era of cooperation and brotherhood for our nations!"
finland.57.a:0 "Even closer to the Reich, even closer to the Furher"

finland.58.t:0 "[From.GetName] Declines"
finland.58.d:0 "We’ve received a message from our ambassador in Berlin, carrying the answer for our request to join the [GER.GetFactionName]- The Reich has Refused! It comes off as a shock to us that the Furher would refuse such an offer, after all the times we stood by Germany. We have been stabbed in the back by our only major ally, the government is outraged by this!"
finland.58.a:0 "The Germans will regret this!"

finland.59.t:0 "[From.GetName] Asks for Protection"
finland.59.d:0 "We have received an envoy from [From.GetName]- they are asking us for protection. Being surrounded by aggressive neighbors, especially to the south, Finland has contacted the Prime Minister of Britain & The American President and concernedly asked for military and diplomatic protection against any possible aggression against its sovereignty and people. Should we accept?"
finland.59.a:0 "Do so, we must protect the democracies of the world"
finland.59.b:0 "Do not, we can't risk any escalation because of Finland."

finland.60.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts"
finland.60.d:0 "News flock from The West, we have finally received an answer to our plea for help. They have agreed! We knew we can count on the west! We can now rest assured that any aggressors from the south will have to deal with [From.GetName], let us hope it's more effective than 1939…."
finland.60.a:0 "The West defends!"

finland.61.t:0 "[From.GetName] Declines"
finland.61.d:0 "News flock from the west, we have finally received an answer to our plea for help! They have refused! We are left in shock and dismay by this turn of events! The last bastion of democracy has refused our beg for help and protection, leaving us vulnerable to any invasion from the south…"
finland.61.a:0 "We've always been alone, we will continue to be"

finland.62.t:0 "Expelling the Subversives"
finland.62.d:0 "It's a decision not unlike the one made by the German leadership years ago. After a short but fiery debate on how to deal with the Jewish problem, our great leader has decided that Finland's Jews are to face deportation and the revocation of Finnish citizenship effective immediately. While the ink from the signed order is still moist, Jews from across Finland are met with police officers ordering them onto trains heading south. Although they're being told that their relocation is temporary, all the trains are going towards the German colony known as the Reichskommissariat Ostland. As the first train crossed the border into German territory, a quickly-written diplomatic cable is sent to the colony's headquarters in Riga."
finland.62.a:0 "A necessity for our new Finland."

finland.63.t:0 "A Finnish Communique"
finland.63.d:0 "An important diplomatic message has reached our Reichskommissariat HQ in Riga, something extremely uncommon for our colony. Our communications office had difficulty translating the document due to a relatively poor understanding of the Finnish language, but once it was eventually translated to German the message rang loud and clear. Due to the inability to accommodate their kind, Finland's Jewish population has been expelled from the country indefinitely. To expedite their departure, Finland's Jews will be deported to the nearest friendly government, that being the Reichskommissariat of Ostland. Seeing how we were given little input in the matter, it's apparent our colonial government must prepare for this sudden shift."
finland.63.a:0 "This is the last thing we need..."

finland.64.t:0 "Finland announces its Ambitions"
finland.64.d:0 "News flock to us from our neighbour Finland, which has been relatively quiet and isolated since the end of Barbarossa and the invasion of The USSR. The Finns have, in a deliberate show of force, announced their military and territorial ambitions for border territories and other regions they claim 'rightful Finnish territory'. This, however, comes as a relatively expected turn of events, as Finnish armament, border patrol increase and overall flexing of muscles have been quite common in the last months, giving us a good idea of what the nation might be up to. We should take this as no joke, as the Finnish people have shown their strengths before, defeating the Red Army both on the defence and the offense. Whatever the case may be, we must stay alert and be prepared. The Finns are coming, and by force."
finland.64.a:0 "Mannerheim's legacy is alive it seems..."

finland.65.t:0 "Democracy Returns"
finland.65.d:0 "In the land of a thousand lakes and million trees, freedom has returned at last. In the previous months we witnessed what can only be described as chaos, as Finland was shook by instability, with an attempted fascist coup by our pro German and Italian assets. The coupists, including parts of the army attempted to occupy Helsinki and storm the government buildings, however, with civil outrage and local armed and police retaliation, the coupists failed to achieve their goal, being arrested and most locked for life behind bars. \n\nIn the aftermath of the coup however, it became clear that Finland needs reforms. Many factions emerged- socialists, conservatives, paternal autocrats, but the strongest one were the Liberal Democrats, with a strong popular support as well. In a few months after the coup elections were held and the liberals emerged victorious with the impressive 52%, forming a new government. Democracy has finally returned to Finland and its people are now truly freed!"
finland.65.a:0 "Long live the free people of Finland!"

finland.66.t:0 "Dictatorship Takes Over"
finland.66.d:0 "In the land of a thousand lakes, Finland stands in turmoil. Just a few weeks ago, Helsinki was shaken by an attempted coup by Pro -azi and fascist elements. The coupists, alongside a part of the army, attempted to occupy the capital and seize important government buildings. They however, did not anticipate the hostility and outrage of the local populace and the eager resistance of local police forces. To say the least, fascists occupying the capital didn't sit well with anyone. The army was soon notified and General Kaarlo, closest to the capital, marched his forces on Helsinki. By the time he got there, some two days after the coup was initially launched, the coupists were already apprehended by local loyalist authorities. Seeing an opportunity, and to bring law and order to Finland, General Kaarlo decided to take power himself. His takeover met no outrage as the populace supported the war hero in his endeavour to neutralise any domestic dangers to Finnish stability and bring order to the country. In the aftermath of the coup, Finland stands a military junta under Kaarlo, arguably more stable and secure than before."
finland.66.a:0 "Long Live Finland! May Kaarlo lead us to a greater future!"

finland.67.t:0 "Envoy from Finland"
finland.67.d:0 "The man from Helsinki arrives without fuss or bustle. Few are there to witness his arrival, in a black-clad motorcade with the Finnish flag, and even fewer welcome him. The government of Perm has long forgotten the protocol for diplomacy outside sabre-rattling - the consensus, in fact, is that following unification the Russias will sit in splendid isolation, free from the machinations of international capital. \n\nThe Premier sighs as he examines the dossier, with the Representative sitting opposite him. There is little that can be done about this man, and certainly the Government has no reason to make enemies where so many already exist. There is, however, a distinct lack of things for the Representative to actually do, something he does not hesitate to point out. \n\nThe man from Helsinki smiles. He has an idea or two. \n\nThat evening the Representative visits a hospital - almost identical to the others in the city save for the letters emblazoned outside it. He carries a bulky case, packed with something wooden and heavy. Nurses escort him to the children’s ward - in awkward Russian he greets the children by name, asking about their hobbies, their favourite foods and their family lives. Then he pulls out something boxy and angular from the case and begins to play. \n\nThe children sit, entranced, as melodies flow like melting ice from the hands of the man. A kantele, the man calls it. It sounds like an angel, walking in the forest, a child whispers. \n\nThe man nods, grinning. He says: In Finland there are many angels, and many forests for them to walk in. Shall I tell you more about them?"

finland.68.t:0 "Kekkonen's Coup"
finland.68.d:0 "The Finnish Parliament echoes with the sound and fury due to a nation in crisis. Urho Kekkonen sits in the centre of it all, surrounded by jostling bureaucrats. The Liberals and the Social Democrats are arguing over some pointless minutiae in the latest introduced bill again - something about the scope of social welfare policies proposed? It’s all terribly irritating to the President. Nothing he wants to hear on National Defense against the Germans, or how party factionalism is tearing the country apart. \n\nNow he claps his hands loud enough to be noticed even in the vast and shadowed spaces of the chamber. He has a executive order to announce, and this one will require no real legislative action to make it through - only their obedience. If these petty democrats can agree on anything, it must be that submission to their betters is preferable to disunity and weakness. \n\nThe Liberals and Social Democrats stare at Kekkonen as he politely informs them that Special Provisions to the Constitution have been introduced by direct executive decree, granting extraordinary powers to shift the composition of Parliament - removing its power over lawmaking and policy in the process. These powers are now in effect, he adds, and will not be suspended until Kekkonen deems fit. \n\nHe calls for a vote. A simple majority will suffice, he smiles. All that is required is to vote - for or against? As the men raise their hands in outraged rejection, the speaker nods to an underling, who speaks in clipped tones into a wire. Soldiers march into the Parliament, dragging the still-protesting away. \n\nKekkonen nods. In the tones of a slightly bored schoolmaster taking a miscreant to task, he asks: \"Shall we try this again? Say my name if you want me in.\""
finland.68.a:0 "Kekkonen. Kekkonen. Kekkonen."
