Focusing on full collectivization of the Nation, along with Military expansionism, this ideology is rather tailored towards diplomatic isolationism.  Viewing the nation as integral to developing socialism, §RMarxism-Leninism-Zhukovism§! Is extremely nationalistic, and is rarely espoused by any groups with Internationalist leanings."
 
 zhdanovshchina:0 "Zhdanovshchina"
 zhdanovshchina_desc:0 "§YZhdanovshchina§!, also known as §YZhdanovism§! is an ideological belief that encompasses all aspects of Soviet life. First shunned by the §YTechnocrats§!, §YZhdanovshchina§! has made a return with the strong devotion of Andrei Zhdanov. A belief that is fixated on purifying communism, all aspects of life are covered under its guidelines down to the slightest details. From embracing political education before science and the economy, to ensuring formality within cultural development, §YZhdanovshchina§! is designed to be the true, ultimate form of Soviet Communism, the purest form of Communism that is not diluted by any senseless emotion."
