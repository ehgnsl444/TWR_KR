### General Events ###

korea.0.t:0 "The Hermit Nation"
korea.0.d:0 "Since the days of the old Joseon kingdom, Korea has been an isolated place. Gradually losing its independence in the late 19th century, the small nation of Korea was occupied and colonised by the Japanese Empire, under which it suffered brutal treatment and as a result of which remains one of the most economically backwards countries in the world. Many different groups resisted, but ultimately it was events far away and outside of Korea's control, with the Pacific War and the defeat of Japan by the United States, that won the Korean people their freedom.\n\nHowever, the freedoms the Korean people won turned out to be lacking. The first independent Korean state, the Korean People's Republic, was established by a broad left-wing coalition as soon as Japan surrendered. It was not to last, however, as the United States, Korea's theoretical liberator, fearing turmoil in Russia and China spiralling out of control, began its East Asian expedition, landing troops in the Russian Far East, Manchuria and the Korean peninsula. The leadership of the young people's Republic were pressured to resign, and a conservative, pro-American 'democratic' Republic installed by US occupation forces under Syngman Rhee. Rhee's officially democratic rule is in practise a near dictatorship, with authoritarian control by the ruling clique. His rule is not so secure, however, as both left wing and and liberal opposition wait for the opportunity to rise up.\n\nWhatever government leads Korea into the future, it will have much to contend with. First, the mass poverty of the Korean people and the backwards nature of the country will have to be dealt with. Korea is also threatened potentially on two sides, as both Washington and Nanjing seek to exert their influence on the geographically strategic nation."
korea.0.a:0 "Daehan Minguk!"
korea.1.t:0 "Protests Begin"
korea.1.d:0 "Led by thousands of students, protests have begun to build in Seoul and other towns across Korea. Perceived corruption, lack of democratic and civil freedoms and pitiful economic and social improvement has fueled discontent against Syngman Rhee's government, and now this discontent seems to be boiling over into real dissent. It remains to be seen how far these protests will go."
korea.1.a:0 "A worrying development"
korea.2.t:0 "Protesters Demand Rhee Resign"
korea.2.d:0 "The recent protests against Rhee's government have grown in strength, the crowds swelling in Seoul outside government buildings. Pressure is mounting on President Syngman Rhee to resign and hand power over to a parliament. If not, his only choice would be to send in the troops and crush the protests by force, though the ensuing violence may severely damage the country and society."
korea.2.a:0 "Crush them!"
korea.2.b:0 "Rhee Resigns"
korea.3.t:0 "Elections"
korea.3.d:0 "With the resignation of President Rhee, and the end of his corrupt one-man rule, the Parliament has announced free elections will go ahead to decide Korea's future. As preparations across the country for the voting goes ahead, it remains to be seen if such an unstable nation can handle the introduction of democracy."
korea.3.a:0 "Democracy for Korea!"
korea.4.t:0 "1952 Election Results"
korea.4.d:0 "Though the election campaigns have been fraught with reports of violence and curruption, the final results are in."
korea.4.a:0 "Liberal-Conservative victory!"
korea.4.b:0 "Leftist victory!"
korea.5.t:0 "Protests Crushed"
korea.5.d:0 "The troops were sent in, and dispersed the protesters. Rhee's position is secure for now, as the opposition lies scattered and protest organisers in cells. However, the size of the movement has shown the enemies that exist in Korea, and the long-term instability of Rhee's government."
korea.5.a:0 "A tough road ahead."
korea.6.t:0 "Actions of the Military"
korea.6.d:0 "As the socialist United Front wins the parliamentary elections, the world looks to the military for their response. Especially with a leftist government having been elected, a military coup may be imminent, and general Chung Il-Kwon would the man to execute it."
korea.6.a:0 "The military stands down."
korea.6.b:0 "The military takes charge."
korea.7.t:0 "Power Struggle"
korea.7.d:0 "With the military standing down, the position of the leftist United Front over the nation is secure. However, while in gaining power they were united, already large ideological differences are tearing them apart. Two main blocs have formed in the coalition - the National Revolutionaries, totalitarian, nationalist communists led by Pak Hon-Yong and inspired by the ideas of the late Kim Il Sung, and the moderates, including both socialists from the days of the brief People's Republic and anarchists. A power struggle is beginning to decide which branch of socialism will take control of the nation."
korea.7.a:0 "Pak's National Revolutonaries!"
korea.7.b:0 "The People's Socialists!"
korea.71.d:0 "The 'People's Socialists' as they call themselves, have won out over the more radical authoritarian communists. Yet a debate still remains, as the mainstream socialists under Lyuh want to forge ahead with their state-led agenda, the anarchists are pushing for an abolition of the state entirely. Debates and votes are held in the various Korean People's Committees."
korea.71.a:0 "A mainstream socialist direction"
korea.71.b:0 "An anarchist direction"
korea.8.t:0 "Found the DPRK"
korea.8.d:0 "With the other socialists forced out of the way, Pak Hon-Yong dominates not only the United Front, but the nation as a whole. With this newfound power, the dream of Kim Il-Sung can finally be realised - the Democratic People's Republic of Korea can be founded, with a strong communist party at its head that will lead the Korean people and nation to greatness."
korea.8.a:0 "Long live the DPRK!"
korea.9.t:0 "Anarchist Triumph"
korea.9.d:0 "Ha Ki-Ra has forced back the authoritarian communist wing of the United Front, bringing his own anarchist faction to the forefront of power. With other 'tyrannical' groups now pushed to the side, he can finally begin the creation of an anarcho-socialist society. The 'Republic' and its government will be dismantled and the Korean People's Association will take its place"
korea.9.a:0 "Down with tyranny!"
korea.10.t:0 "Purges in the Military"
korea.10.d:0 "Following the wave of recent protests, evidence has emerged that parts of the army planned to defect to the protesters' side had the the situation got any worse. With Rhee's government back in control, this possibility cannot be allowed. While the majority of the army and the general staff remains loyal, officers of questionable loyalty will be removed from their positions and potentially imprisoned. This may have a negative effect on our army's battle-readiness, but when new officers are trained to fill the gaps left, the military should recover."
korea.10.a:0 "'Reorganise' the army."
korea.11.t:0 "Compromise with the Conservative Opposition"
korea.11.d:0 "It is clear with the opposition that exists Rhee cannot rule alone. As a result, and to prevent radical forces gaining traction, a series of compromises have been struck between Rhee and his ruling 'Liberal' party and the various moderate opposition groups to allow them piecemeal reforms and places in government. This should ensure stability for the future."
korea.11.a:0 "A united Government."
korea.12.t:0 "Destroy the Opposition"
korea.12.d:0 "The recent protests have shown even the moderate opposition cannot be trusted. Their parties will dispanded and their leaders arrested for the good of the nation's stability"
korea.12.a:0 "End the Opposition."
korea.13.t:0 "Hunt Down the Communists"
korea.13.d:0 "With the conservative opposition dealt with, the government has turned to the greatest threat to Korean stability - the radical left. Various socialist groups conspire to overthrow the government and cause trouble, and with the army and apparatus of state back under Rhee's control, it has become time to wipe them out once and for all."
korea.13.a:0 "Red Menace Destroyed."
korea.14.t:0 "Socialists Banned from Parliament"
korea.14.d:0 "The ruling coalition has made the decision to ban socialist parties from the Korean Parliament, citing concerns of a threat to democracy posed by their revolutionary ideology. Radical Leftists have also been banned from running for any kind of public office."
korea.14.a:0 "For Democratic Stability!"
korea.15.t:0 "Compromise with the Left"
korea.15.d:0 "The various right-wing and centre-right parties in power have struck a deal with the left, agreeing to rule the country together and discuss matters between them. While this may hurt the ability of the Parliament to pass reforms quickly, it guarantees stability and a true democratic compromise to the country."
korea.15.a:0 "For True Democracy!"
korea.16.t:0 "Reject Authoritarianism"
korea.16.d:0 "The Korean Parliament has issued a proclamation denouncing the previous authoritarian government of the country and authoritarianism as a whole. Those involved in past crimes against the nation are removed and tried, and the government swears to uphold the true democracy, now established."
korea.16.a:0 "Never another police state"
korea.17.t:0 "Encourage Democracy"
korea.17.d:0 "For the Korean nation to be a true democracy, political discourse and action must be encouraged amongst the population. We will go out into the towns, villages and farms to bring democracy to the people, and encourage the creation of new parties and political groups."
korea.17.a:0 "Build a democratic culture"
korea.18.t:0 "The Peasant Communes"
korea.18.d:0 "To build our anarchist society, the structure of society in the countryside that covers the vast majority of Korea's land and people must be changed. The creation of thousands of small communes across the country is underway."
korea.18.a:0 "For the peasants!"
korea.19.t:0 "Dismantle Central Government"
korea.19.d:0 "The Korean Nation is well on the way to being tranformed into the egalitarian, stateless community it was always meant to be. With the reforms put into motion, it is time for the government to dissolve itself, leaving only the minimum central leadership required to rally the nation against any external threat that may try to destroy our bold new society. Ha Ki-Ra will remain as a figurehead, the hero of the people, though he no longer rules as a leader of a state, but as a softly guiding hand to the autonomous communities of Korea."
korea.19.a:0 "True Freedom!"
korea.20.t:0 "Spread the Word"
korea.20.d:0 "Though we have seized power, the vast majority of the country is uneducated and unaware of the tenets of socialism. We must go into the countryside to educate the peasants and uplift them towards upstanding comrades."
korea.20.a:0 "Into the countryside!"
korea.21.t:0 "The Great Purge"
korea.21.d:0 "Now that we have cemented our power over the nation, we must destroy those elements that seek to destroy the revolution. We must hunt down, not only those of opposing parties, but those within our mists. The anarchist branch of the United Front must be destroyed, and even those that claim to follow our doctrine cannot all be trusted..."
korea.21.a:0 "Death to the Counter-revolutionaries!"
korea.22.t:0 "Songun"
korea.22.d:0 "For our people, our nation and the glorious revolution to survive, we must institute the system of 'songun', a policy of focusing the efforts of the state on the military. Those that would destroy our people surround us, and we must prepare all arms to defend ourselves from the inevitable invasion."
korea.22.a:0 "To arms!"
korea.23.t:0 "Martial Law"
korea.23.d:0 "Following the seizing of power by the Korean military, led by Chung Il-Kwon, against the recently elected leftist government, the provisional authority has declared a state of Martial Law in Korea. Recently won democratic and civil rights have been suspended indefinitely 'for the security of the nation agaisnt radical forces'."
korea.23.a:0 "For stability."
korea.24.t:0 "Topple the Communists"
korea.24.d:0 "The radical left's attempt at power has been thwarted, and it is now time to prevent them from ever trying to do so again. Their leaders will be rounded up and imprisoned, and their parties dissolved."
korea.24.a:0 "Crush the reds!"
korea.25.t:0 "Dealing with the Democrats"
korea.25.d:0 "Korea's experiment in democracy has been a failure, with radical forces taking hold and pushing the country to the brink of destruction. We must prevent any such democratic ideals from boiling over into action, and maintain a strong government to keep the nation on the right path."
korea.25.a:0 "A strong hand."
korea.26.t:0 "National Liberation Day"
korea.26.d:0 "Today, on the day known as Gwangbokjeol, the Korean nation and people celebrate our independence and liberation from Japanese domination following the defeat of the Japanese Empire in the pacific war. A national holiday will be observed, and celebrations will be held in the cities, towns and villages across the country."
korea.26.a:0 "Long Live Korea!"
korea.27.t:0 "Join the TA"
korea.27.d:0 "A decision has been made - Korea will attempt the join the Toronto Accord, to solidify our alliance with the United States. There is no guarantee they will accept, but if they do, this would be an important step for our new country's path on the international stage."
korea.27.a:0 "Send an application"
korea.28.t:0 "Application Accepted"
korea.28.d:0 "Our application to the Toronto Accord has been accepted. We are now a member"
korea.28.a:0 "Excellent"
korea.29.t:0 "Application Refused"
korea.29.d:0 "Unfortunately, our application to the Toronto Accord has been refused by its council, citing concerns of security and the tensions it could cause."
korea.29.a:0 "Unfortunate..."
korea.30.t:0 "Sermons on the Mount"
korea.30.d:0 "Dawn sweeps over that mountain east of Seoul slowly, like the veil of a bride slowly and expectantly lifted. The followers of that little church, of course, are already there and have in fact been awake through the night, deep in vigil and prayer. These are important times for the nation, after all, and despite some public suspicion (the Churches stayed awfully silent in the War, their leadership held hostage by a hostile Japanese administration) the Churches are eager to prove their loyalty to the new Korea.\n\nThere is much to pray about, but this morning the church is thankful: with a deep breath the pastor, fresh out of the seminary and with youthful energy ruddying his cheeks, leads them all on a prayer of deliverance for President Rhee and his circle of advisors. Who knows what would have become of the Church had it not been for the President's firm rooting out of the Communist subversives? And although the Churches are still poor and their worshippers still desperate, the hand of God has followed them through Japanese sword and fire, and it will not leave them now. And the Message must be spread - here the pastor's voice grows urgent - for the King is coming soon, with flaming banners and angel armies. Korea must be ready when He does.\n\nThen the main order of business begins: the group, about a hundred strong, breaks into little cells of about ten to a dozen, and together the praying begins in a hundred voices - all at once. It breaks upon the cold winds of the morning like a strange and wonderful chorus, voices of hope, desire, anticipation and fear flowing into each other as streams into a river. This is Korean prayer: intense, overwhelming even for new converts, but a thing of beauty if one's ears are attuned to the sound. All across Korea prayers like these soar into the wind as dawn breaks across the new nation, an unveiling in spirit and in flesh - and another word for unveiling, in the old Greek, is apokalypsis. Apocalypse."
korea.30.a:0 "Praise be to God."
korea.30.b:0 "Who will rid our land of these fanatics?"
korea.31.t:0 "Talks with Vietnam"
korea.31.d:0 "If we are to go forward with our new people's government, it only makes sense to talk with the preeminent socialist nation in the region - Vietnam. We will send a diplomatic delegation to discuss foreign policy with them."
korea.31.a:0 "Send our best!"
korea.32.t:0 "Envoys from Korea"
korea.32.d:0 "The new left-wing regime in Korea has come to us, sending a delegation that is looking to discuss foreign policy in a continent of powers hostile to socialism. Hopefully, good discussions can be had."
korea.32.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
korea.33.t:0 "Korea goes alone"
korea.33.d:0 "It seems the recent talks did not have the impression we had hoped. The Koreans have thanked us, but announced they will be forging their own path in foreign policy.\n\nIt seems the 'hermit kingdom' is back to its old ways, even with a socialist government."
korea.33.a:0 "What a shame..."
korea.34.t:0 "Korea asks to Join the Front"
korea.34.d:0 "It seems the recent talks have been a success. The Korean government, impressed by our planning, has officially asked to forge a military alliance under the umbrella of the new Proletarian Front."
korea.34.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
korea.34.b:0 "We don't need them..."
korea.35.t:0 "Vietnam Accepts"
korea.35.d:0 "The Vietnamese have accepted, and we have joined as a military partner within the Asian Proletarian Front!"
korea.35.a:0 "Excellent!"
korea.36.t:0 "Vietnam Refuses"
korea.36.d:0 "For whatever reason, the Vietnamese have unexpectedly refused our entry into a military pact within the Asian Proletarian Front."
korea.36.a:0 "What a shame..."
korea.37.t:0 "The Way Forwards"
korea.37.d:0 "Now that the socialist People's Party has taken power as in the days of the brief People's Republic that was destroyed by the Americans, we face a choice as to the direction we should take the country. On the one hand, many are calling for us to stick to our socialist ideals and create a truly fair and just socialist society, free from the evils of capitalism or foreign imperialism. While an appealing idea, this would obviously meet stiffer resistance, and possibly be more likely to incur the wrath of envious foreign superpowers. Another proposal is that we pursue socialism of a more moderate variety, perhaps something more similar to social democracy. We allow elements of capitalism to exist, but use the power of the state to create a fair standard of living for all our people.\n\nWhich path shall we go down?"
korea.37.a:0 "We must maintain true socialism!"
korea.37.b:0 "Moderation is key"
korea.38.t:0 "Northern Fortifications Finished"
korea.38.d:0 "The northern border fortifications that are under construction have been completed."
korea.38.a:0 "Excellent!"
korea.39.t:0 "Fortification Upgrades Finished"
korea.39.d:0 "The upgrades to the northern border fortifications that were underway have been completed."
korea.39.a:0 "Excellent!"

KOR_creeping_barrage_desc:0 "The strategy of a ‘creeping barrage' moving just in front of advancing infantry columns is an old one, but nonetheless effective and suited to an infantry-based army. We should learn it and adopt it in our own strategies."
KOR_industrialised_army:0 "An Industrialised Army"
KOR_industrialised_army_desc:0 "In modern times, the industrial power behind an army is one of the most important elements of victory. With heavy weapons developed, we can begin to truly field a modern, industrialised army."

### US - Korea Events ###

uskorea.1.t:0 "Korea Betrays Us"
uskorea.1.d:0 "The Korean nation we liberated from Japan during the Pacific war has turned their backs on us, whether because they have fallen to a radical ideology or simply turned towards our rival, China, for protection instead of the United States. While East Asia remains an area for America to spread its influence, Korea has been lost for now."
uskorea.1.a:0 "Withdraw Diplomats"
uskorea.2.t:0 "Korea Applies to the TA"
uskorea.2.d:0 "With the Korean government long aligning towards the west, and the United States in particular, much to China's frustration, the most significant move yet has been made - The Korean government has officially applied to join the Toronto Accord alliance. This would of course give us many benefits, with Korea providing yet another base to project power in East Asia, along with Japan, and a strong Korean state perhaps being a valuable local ally. However, the invitation of a small, newly independent Asian nation into the alliance would be unprecedented, and would also undoubtably increase tensions with China in a region they already see as theirs. How should we procede?"
uskorea.2.a:0 "Let them join"
uskorea.2.b:0 "It's not worth it"
uskorea.3.t:0 "Korea Requests a Destroyer"
uskorea.3.d:0 "Diplomats from Korea have approached us, asking to purchase a Destroyer with which to begin construction of their own navy. While one less WW2 destroyer would probably not do our fleet any harm, we must decide if Korea is a reliable enough ally to be given this vessel, and if it is worth it to do so."
uskorea.3.a:0 "Accept the offer"
uskorea.3.b:0 "Keep the destroyer"
uskorea.4.t:0 "America Accepts"
uskorea.4.d:0 "The American government has accepted our offer, and transferred a destroyer to our new navy."
uskorea.4.a:0 "Great!"
uskorea.5.t:0 "America Refuses"
uskorea.5.d:0 "The American government has refused our offer, and has not transferred a destroyer to our new navy."
uskorea.5.a:0 "Unfortunate"
uskorea.6.t:0 "Korea wants to join"
uskorea.6.d:0 "The government of Korea, having spent the last few months forging closer ties between our two nations, has requested entry into our faction. Accepting would undoubtably expand our influence, but risks antagonising the United States. Should we accept?"
uskorea.6.a:0 "Accept them"
uskorea.6.b:0 "It's not worth it"
uskorea.7.t:0 "China Accepts"
uskorea.7.d:0 "China has accepted our entry into their faction"
uskorea.7.a:0 "Great!"
uskorea.8.t:0 "China Refuses"
uskorea.8.d:0 "China has refused our entry into their faction"
uskorea.8.a:0 "Unfortunate..."
uskorea.9.t:0 "Korea requests technical aid"
uskorea.9.d:0 "As part of its effort to align towards us, Korea has requested our technical aid in improving the technology of their country in general and their armed forces in particular. It would cost little to us, but would benefit such a poor country a lot."
uskorea.9.a:0 "Of course!"
uskorea.9.b:0 "Not worth our time"
uskorea.10.t:0 "America Accepts"
uskorea.10.d:0 "As expected, the Americans have accepted and are now giving us technical help."
uskorea.10.a:0 "Great!"
uskorea.11.t:0 "America Refuses"
uskorea.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Americans have inexplicably refused to give us any technical aid"
uskorea.11.a:0 "Unfortunate."
uskorea.12.t:0 "Korea requests military advisors"
uskorea.12.d:0 "The government of Korea has now come to us asking for an official set of military advisors to help build and train their army. If we were to send a small group of military experts to help their military development, it would be of significant aid to them. Shall we accept?"
uskorea.12.a:0 "Of course!"
uskorea.12.b:0 "Not worth our time"
uskorea.13.t:0 "America Accepts"
uskorea.13.d:0 "As expected, the Americans have accepted and are now giving us a set of military advisors."
uskorea.13.a:0 "Great!"
uskorea.14.t:0 "America Refuses"
uskorea.14.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Americans have inexplicably refused to give us any military advisors."
uskorea.14.a:0 "What a shame..."
uskorea.15.t:0 "Korea Opens Up"
uskorea.15.d:0 "In an effort to accelerate the economic development and growth of their country, the government of Korea is encouraging foreign investors and firms, especially from the US, to invest and do business within their country. This new market opening up provides a brilliant economic opportunity for us."
uskorea.15.a:0 "Great!"
uskorea.16.t:0 "Restore US-Korea Relations?"
uskorea.16.d:0 "Many among our party still harbour ill feelings about the Americans - after all, they are the ones who destroyed our People's Republic and installed a repressive regime under Rhee. That said, China may ultimately be the greater threat to our independence, and with fascism a grave threat in Europe, America has shown increased willingness to work with socialists in recent years. Our moderate, 'social democratic' direction may be more agreeable to them, and in particular if we could negotiate a restored guarantee of American protection of our independence, it may help defend us from a perhaps greater threat to our nation in the form of China."
uskorea.16.a:0 "No working with the Americans!"
uskorea.16.b:0 "It's for the best"
uskorea.17.t:0 "Korean Government Seeks Rapprochement"
uskorea.17.d:0 "When a large coalition of socialists, many of them very radical, took power in Korea, we broke off relations. However, with more moderate social democrats coming to the forefront, the new government has opened talks with our representatives, requesting a restoration of pre-election relations, and even a restored guarantee of their independence. While some ideological purists insist that working with radical socialists is never wise, the benefits of backing this more moderate left-wing government against the Chinese is very apparent. Shall we accept?"
uskorea.17.a:0 "Accept - restore relations"
uskorea.17.b:0 "It's not worth working with radicals!"
uskorea.18.t:0 "America Accepts"
uskorea.18.d:0 "The United States has accepted our request - diplomatic relations are restored, and they once again guarantee our independence!"
uskorea.18.a:0 "Excellent"
uskorea.19.t:0 "America Refuses"
uskorea.19.d:0 "The United States has unfortunately refused our request to normalise diplomatic relations."
uskorea.19.a:0 "What a shame"
uskorea.20.t:0 "Request Tsushima?"
uskorea.20.d:0 "Ever since the surrender of Japan in 1945, the island of Tsushima, or in Korean, Daemado, has been under American military occupation. The island lies between the Korean peninsula and Japan, and Korea has some, albeit arguable, historical claims to them. Now that we have decided to align ourselves diplomatically closer towards the US, an effort could be made to request the territory is transferred to us."
uskorea.20.a:0 "They're not worth it"
uskorea.20.b:0 "Yes, the islands should be ours!"
uskorea.21.t:0 "Koreans Request Tsushima"
uskorea.21.d:0 "Ever since the surrender of Japan in 1945, the island of Tsushima has been under our military occupation. The island lies between the Korean peninsula and Japan, and Korea, as part of an overall effort to align towards us diplomatically, has put forward some, albeit arguable, historical claims to them. Of course, transferring territory to Korea that Japan sees as theirs could disgruntle a nation we want to rebuild, but with Korea signalling its intent to become an ally, an act of good will could bring them closer to our sphere and strengthen them."
uskorea.21.a:0 "Agree to transfer the islands"
uskorea.21.b:0 "Decline their request"
uskorea.22.t:0 "America Accepts"
uskorea.22.d:0 "The United States has accepted our request - Daemado has been transferred to us!"
uskorea.22.a:0 "Excellent"
uskorea.23.t:0 "America Refuses"
uskorea.23.d:0 "The United States has unfortunately refused our request to take control of Daemado"
uskorea.23.a:0 "What a shame"

chinakorea.1.t:0 "Korea Requests Guarantee"
chinakorea.1.d:0 "As part of the culmination of their policy of alignment towards us, the government of Korea has requested we guarantee their independence and come fully under our diplomatic protection. While this would expand our influence, it could certainly also drag us into new conflicts. How shall we respond?"
chinakorea.1.a:0 "Of course we shall accept."
chinakorea.1.b:0 "Politely refuse"
chinakorea.2.t:0 "China Accepts"

chinakorea.3.a:0 "Unfortunate..."
chinakorea.4.t:0 "Korea - Joint Military Exercises"
chinakorea.4.d:0 "As part of an effort to align towards us, the Korean government has requested a series of joint military exercises in which our armies will simulate missions and gain valuable experience and training. This would boost the experience of our own armies, but especially would aid the Koreans in training their young army and open the door to further friendship. Shall we accept?"
chinakorea.4.a:0 "Of course!"
chinakorea.4.b:0 "It's not worth it"
chinakorea.5.t:0 "China Accepts"
