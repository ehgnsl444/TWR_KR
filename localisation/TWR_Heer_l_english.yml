HGR_Rethink_The_Economy_desc:0 "Like on most subjects, the Wehrmacht's officer corps is deeply divided about the way in which the German economy should be administered. On one side, the clique associated with Field Marshal Rommel has consistently advocated for us to administer the existing system more efficiently, with any structural changes being a concern for a future civilian government. Opposing this view one finds three characters who otherwise find it hard to agree on anything: Field Marshals Spiedel, Manstein, and Halder. Although all of them, and their respective factions do want to see fundamental change in the economy, they don't particularly agree on what exactly that change should be. Both Manstein and Halder seem to prefer the Wehrmacht to take a much larger role, whilst Spidel and the outright liberal elements in our midst want to separate the military from economics as much as possible."

HGR_The_Greatest_Army_desc:0 "The Heer, the modern day successors of the elite Prussian Hussars, annihilated 2 of the world's strongest armies in the fields and the beaches of France. A year later, the same Heer went on a rampage into the depths of the Colossal lands of Russia, its mighty panzers destroying wave after wave of red troops. It scared the so called industrial giant of USA, home of the "greedy jewish bankers of wall street" to not put its nose in europe where it doesn't belong. The Heer is strong and made up of invincible German steel, but recent developments in the Fatherland, and our new regime has seemed to arouse the world in a sense of uneasiness. Those who think ill of the Reich may soon make greater moves, and the Heer is in a very difficult position to assert its role and our regime's strength. In victory, it remains exhausted after recent wars and the insurgencies in the eastern territories. The world needs to be shown that the Reich along with the Heer is the strongest in the world."

Most are of little consequence, but in respect to the Wehrmacht, it is a different situation. Most of the Heer is and will continue to be unquestionably loyal to the regime, however the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine are trickier to handle. While many have reaffirmed their loyalty to the new regime, at least for now, there is some uneasiness in their ranks, all of which can surely be put to rest with a few new air wings of top of the line jet aircraft for the Luftwaffe and a few new ships with modern missiles for the Kriegsmarine."

In view of this fact, it is necessary to commission studies for a major re-think of the economy. \n\nAlready, two camps are already emerging from this: One faction, led by General Speidel and the Economic Department, which argues that the Wehrmacht should disassociate itself from the economy as much as possible, and engage in wide-reaching privatization of the enterprises we already control. On the other hand, Gehlen and much of the military organizations that control our eastern empire's finances, had suggested we double down on controlling the economy. While this could lead us on the road to war, it would also cement our rule over Germany."

"are ultimately to the detriment not only of the German economy but of its defensive capabilities. \n\nIn short, by having the Wehrmacht oversee these areas of the economy, we are failing to adequately administer them, while simultaneously wasting our own resources, which should instead be focused on improving operational efficiency." 
HGR_Regional_Businesses:0 "Regional Businesses"
HGR_Regional_Businesses_desc:0 "Bavarian cars, Prussian manufactures, Ostmarkian tourism, holstein shipyards... Under the current economic system, all of these regional specializations are discouraged. However, we now accept that the comparative advantage of each region in the provision of goods and services is of vital importance to economic efficiency and sustainability. \n\nIn view of this fact, we will start to provide tax breaks and subsidies to specific industries in different areas of the Reich, which should ensure economic diversification in no time."
HGR_Help_From_Experts:0 "Recruit Economists"

HGR_Simplify_Tax_Codes:0 "Simplifying Our Tax Code"
HGR_Simplify_Tax_Codes_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the late Fuhrer's balancing act between all the different factionst that support NSDAP rule meant that too many promises and favors were given out to a wide variety of economic interests. This has resulted in a somewhat... confusing tax code which grants such things as an exemption from war profiteering to businesses which can demonstrate they employ at least "56 employees from Linz, Ostmark," and subsidies to firms that contribute "8% of excess biyearly profits to the Adolf Hitler National Art Museum." \n\nIf we ever want the economy to work normally again, we eliminate these admittedly strange exceptions in our tax code, so as to encourage more investment by aspiring middle class entrepreneurs."
HGR_Laxer_Economics:0 "A Laxed Economy"
HGR_Laxer_Economics_desc:0 "The time has come to liquidate the byzantine controls which the NSDAP bureaucracy has imposed on the economy. After all, it simply remains inconsistent to have such controls after we've reformed everything else. Thus, things like price controls and incomes policies are simply out of step with German economic reality, an error that must be corrected. We are sure that the local authorities whose privileges we are stripping away by doing this will understand, and if they don't, the Wehrmacht is always to enforce the law."
HGR_Military_Cooperations:0 "Military-Owned Cooperations"

We beat everyone else to take it, and if Thomas and his liberal friends at the economic department think we are about to hand over the spoi... Responsibility for administering the Reich, well then they are wrong. \n\nFirst things first: Clearly the NSDAP didn't do a very good job with the economy. Years of spending on Speer's megalomania and the SS's monstrosities, bundled with ridiculous regulations imposed by the NSDAP have destroyed any semblance of efficiency. On the other hand, we in the wehrmacht are renowned for our efficiency, which the economy could make good use of. For instance, if we were to centralize oil extraction under a single entity run by a Generalmajor, it would do wonders for its productivity."
HGR_Rationing:0 "Introduce Rationing"
HGR_Rationing_desc:0 "All the heads of our state-run industries are in agreement: The economy is overproducing food and underproducing armaments. For the sake of efficiency, we must switch production. However, this brings up the question of the price of food, which will necessarily escalate as supply becomes smaller. \n\nWhy, obviously people will need to consume less food. During the war, the English tried a system by which each person was allotted the same number of "points" to buy textile, edibles, and other goods. If we were to implement a similar method of containing consumption, it might anger some greedy people, but it will be to the benefit of the fatherland."
HGR_Profits_Fund_Army:0 "Fundings For the Army"
HGR_Profits_Fund_Army_desc:0 "With increasing exports of all the goods that we have rationed, there is now a hefty budget surplus for us to spend. Sadly, not even this meets the requirements set out by the newly appointed head of the OKW Economic Department for an expansion of the Wehrmacht. Alas, we will have to borrow. \n\nBy initiating a "national bonds" campaign, we may be able to borrow from the people at a negligible interest rate. However, all projections seem to indicate we will also need to negotiate with the banks to finance the deficit spending. This may be expensive in the long term, but it worked in 1939 and it shall work again!"

HGR_Old_Ways_desc:0 "We never intended Wehrmacht rule over the country to be permanent, and we cannot therefore endeavor to change the foundations of the economy. As the caretaker government, we must limit ourselves to refining the existing economic institutions. \n\nThe German economy is a complex web of state-owned enterprises, mass slavery, private monopolies, NSDAP-approved trade unions, and leftover measures from the days of total war, all kept in relative harmony by a series of gentleman's agreements and other unofficial understandings. Even if we have endeavored not to fundamentally change this fact, we can at least formalize its status so as to defuse the ticking time bomb that it has become.

HGR_Funding_The_War_Machine:0 "Funding the War Machine"
HGR_Funding_The_War_Machine_desc:0 "The Wermacht sacrificed much to bring peace to Germany. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to suggest that we should get priorities in the rebuilding process. As Feldmarschall Rommel has pointed out, once we hand over the administration to the NSDAP, the wermachts recommendations will likely be ignored once again.

HGR_Fire_The_Guns:0 "Fire the Artillery"
HGR_Fire_The_Guns_desc:0 "One thing an army can never have enough is guns, especially some of those bigger guns, they are employed by the infantry, panzergrenadiers and even the panzers, they can be used to saturate enemy positions with hellfire from far or provide fire support directly in the field, right now the Heer uses several artillery guns, but in terms of quantity and quality the artillery has suffered much, much of our stocks are from the war era, and many were lost due to attrition in the east, even today regular partisan raids are able to capture some of them, this slow decline of the artillery is unacceptable, many in the government still believe in the artillery and in its punch, and are pushing for an emphasis to build up the artillery arm of the Heer."
HGR_Legged_First:0 "Focus on Our Soldiers"

The German soldier is the world's most lethal and effective fighter, he does not need any sophisticated chemical substance to perform well, if adequate care and rest is provided, their loyalty to national socialism and their inherent "superiority" guarantees that they can destroy even the mightiest enemy."
HGR_Military_Civil_Services:0 "Military Civil Services"

The OKH will conduct an exam each year, to select officers who will act as military administrators, due to the prestige involved of such posts, the exam would be very competitive, this will lead to the creation of a new civil service comprising of Heer personnel who will be significantly more capable and competent than their regular civilian counterparts."

The recent events at home and an outlook of bleak future makes these polizei an important asset, recruitment from the regular Heer for such units needs to be stepped up, they will be deployed and will counter any action by fifth columnists or partisans."

After the recent event in the homeland, rising tensions and activities in our territories by partisans and fifth columnists are all creating a tense atmosphere, the current Feuerschutzpolizei has largely remained unchanged in organization, training and size and is inadequate to respond to a national crisis, immediate steps need to be taken to reform, retool and retrain it to create a new and highly effective Feuerschutzpolizei that can answer to a wide variety of disasters from small factory accidents to massive national emergencies.

Recent situations, inherent disloyalty in the local populace and some suspected influence by the Toronto accords have made even something as simple as garrisoning difficult, supply lines are disrupted, troop trains diverted, regular raids are launched by the partisans, lone wolf suicidal attacks on military bases, suicide bombing of german parts of towns, our garrisons can be cut off at any time, they must be taught in professional tactics and ways to deal with any such foreseen situations."

But the German technological advances have grind down to a halt, most notably the Uranprojekt which was barely completed, no dedicated organization exists for R&D, many absurd pet projects of party members are focused rather than developing actual ones, some of the technologies that do get built, are created with only one purpose, a combined development effort can lead to creation of, for example, an aircraft that is suitable for all three roles air superiority, close air support and naval roles ,and the West has clearly achieved a lead in technology in the last few years, the new regime wants a strong military, drawing its main support base from it, it has been very worried about this widening "technological gap" and has necessitated the requisite funding and ordered the OKW to release servicemen with the proper technical background to establish a new R&D department, hopefully this will lead to creation of new viable technologies, rather than a "Jew Detector", which was a project being worked upon due to the patronage of a party member."

No matter how influential the panzers become, the infantry is and will continue to remain the face of the Heer, the OKH, acting from strict directives of the government has mandated the Waffenamt to ensure that every german soldier is equipped with the most modern rifle."

The Reich, in order to ensure a base for its war efforts requires more factories, more factories in new locations will enable diversification of the production efforts, and an overall peacetime production can allow us to build up reserve stocks for wartime, ask any MG 42 gunner how many times he needs to replace his barrel, in order to prepare for any unforeseen incident , and we must secure the production on the homefront."

With the recent events in the fatherland, the ability to defend the Reich is a priority, and only the best equipment is needed to fight, the jets are the present and the future of aerial fighting, the conservative parts of the Wehrmacht believes the jets to be too good to be true, but they are actually too good and true, the jet must be emphasised on, if the air war is to won."

Apart from all the new possibilities in offensive capabilities, there are other new defensive possibilities too, new revolutionary air defense systems are possible, Messerschmitt is working on some groundbreaking ideas, our own scientists and foreign ones are exploring the possibilities of creating man portable anti air weapons, such new ideas are thrilling and at the same time threatening if our enemies were to gain a lead in any of the fields."

But since their inception, they have been a thorn in the Heer command structure, while acting as traditional army units on the ground, they are commanded by Luftwaffe officers, the OKH has "requested" the OKL to transfer the control of all the Fallschirmjäger units to the Heer, this will enable a more judicious use of these elite troops and better coordination with the army units."

As of now the Heer is primarily and extensively engaged in countering the partisan movements, and after the recent events in the fatherland, it has other priorities, the Toronto accords sit in the west, hiding in the shadows, wishing the Reich's demise, the massive forces of the Toronto accords have to cross the channel and the Atlantic to threaten the Reich, to protect the Reich, and despite the unwillingness of the government to invest in branches other than Heer, it understands that only the Kriegsmarine can protect the West."

Already the government has contacted Organization Todt to start work, all manners of civilian visits to the coastline  will be banned and strictly enforced, to prevent any potential security compromise, this programme will ensure that no non German ever dares to set or rather be physically unable to set foot on the German coastline, first facing the deadly Wolfpacks , then coming under heavy fire from coasts artillery and legendarily ships like the Bismarck, only to find a big gray wall preventing any landings."

The Regime and its preference over the Heer has decided to create a Warfare Command office that will be formed and staffed by the OKH and will be responsible for all aspects of wartime planning, with the the OKW being relegated to a backward role of simply acting as a liaison for the OKL and OKM, this will ensure coordination and a degree of autonomy for the Heer's operational capability while also ensuring it receives the necessary priority for new personnel and equipment."

The second war saw him becoming close friends with Adolf Hitler - despite a brief fall from grace in 1938 following a botched attempt at subordinating the Hitlerjugend to the Heer. Rommel rose to international fame for his actions in France during the European War and subsequently quickly became an Accord and Reich propaganda favorite. With the Reich falling into civil war following his friends death, Rommel led the German Heer valiantly against the pretenders to the throne and at the end of the civil war secured the reformist faction of the Heer ultimate power over what is left of the glorious Reich, his protegé Hans Speidel assuming the position of leader.\n\nYet all, it turns out, was not as it seems and following Speidel's attempt to transition the Reich from an orthodox Nazi state into an oligarchy, Rommel has overthrown the very man he helped put into power. Declaring himself the new Führer and making sure that his late friends legacy remains untarnished. With Rommel's coup the dream of a new Reich has effectively died."

twrheer.1.t:0 "Electing a Reichspräsident"
twrheer.1.d:0 "With the foundation of our power unsteady, and our legitimacy ever eroding, our movement calls for a face. We need a man of status with the record to prove it. A man of unquestionable loyalty, but one who will toe the line even if his convictions do not allow it. A man of presence, who can serve as a spokesperson for our regime and its actions. Three men have come up, none of which are ideal, but they are our only options.\n\nThe first is Friedrich Eberhard von Mackensen, a quiet and ugly brute. He has only managed to get so far because of his father, Field Marshal August von Mackensen. Still, he has shown himself fiercely loyal to the Reich. He is the Heer's man, most definitely, but his character is not flawless. He doesn't hold a very glamorous figure, his face is not that of a spokesperson. He can show the world the militaristic and oppressive nature of our regime.\n\nThe second is Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, the legendary war hero of the East African resistance campaign during the Great War. His status is unmatched, but the Heer is scared to grant him the power of Reichspräsident. He has been under surveillance ever since he refused to fulfill Hitler's requests by cursing in Hitler's face. He is both indignant and impassioned, qualities of a spokesperson but not of a puppet. Perhaps a reformist option, or a foolish decision by granting a babbling chimp such power.\n\nLast but not least, Wilhelm Canaris, a former Admiral and a former chief of the Abwehr. Canaris is an oddball, appearing to be more of a timid figure with a long lasting rumour about his distaste towards Adolf Hitler. Canaris is certainly the most inoffensive option, albeit dull.\n\nWhatever the choice, we can all agree that this step is necessary."

twrheer.2.d:0 "A renowned general of the Reich, Erwin Rommel was a model follower of Adolf Hitler during his reign. Rommel was a part of the Heer Faction during the power struggle, where his popular image was used to gather support for the military. However, when Erwin Rommel was asked on the what he feels about politics, he showed an active disinterest.\n\nBut recently, Rommel's attitude has changed. Erwin Rommel approached the state media, offering to hold a speech for national unity. Which was a lie, as the speech took an unexpected turn when Rommel went on a diatribe, speaking about his experience with Adolf Hitler and hinting a sense of disgust at the current plans for reforms.\n\nRightfully so, the majority of Germany has interpreted this speech as a declaration of oppsition against Hans Speidel's Moderates. If Rommel were to use his fame to pursuit political actions, he would become a formidable challenge for the current administration."

On one hand, Hans Speidel is the leader of the reform faction, a group of generals and ministers that hold nationalistic views but disagrees with Germany's racial policies, which are now calling for the abolishment of the Nuremberg Laws. Opposing the reform faction is the conservative camp, led by Erwin Rommel, which argues that drastically changing previous legislations would greatly damage Germany's stability, claiming that the conservatives are opposed to repelling the Nuremberg Laws not because of political reasons, but because of a sense of duty and loyalty to the fatherland.\n\nRegardless of what both sides think, the fate of the regime shall be determined by the military."

However, the lack of support from locals have rendered this plan an utter failure.\n\nBut, with a new Germany emerging, Hans Speidel's willingness to spend resources on a new colonial policy has encouraged Krzeptowski to make his new proposal. Calling for a free state, Krzeptowski suggest that the minds of the populace and be changed with time, and the first step of this reform shall be supported by the German government. With a Polish-Goralenvolk Free State, the people of Poland shall be allowed autonomy in the South, gradually convincing the Polish people into supporting the Germans in a sense of brotherly unity."

Lettow-Vorbeck is a widely popular and a famous figurehead, and these qualities are what made him the perfect candidate for the position of Reichspräsident.\n\nWith a swift consensus, von Lettow-Vorbeck was elected.

Generally, von Mackensen is a plain militarist, which might be what the military wants from a Reichspräsident, a public figurehead that only serves the purpose of following orders for the benefit of the faction as a whole.\n\nEmpowered by the officers, Eberhard von Mackensen was quickly appointed as the Reichspräsident by the military. His apoliticism and easily manipulated agendas might be advantageous for the government, but he is certainly not a popular figure amongst the public."

Ever since Speidel's descision to enact drastic reforms, Rommel had grown more and more disgusted at his partner behind closed doors. However, hostilities between the two escalated, as Rommel became openly critical towards the regime, claiming that his intervention into German politics is a necessary step to preserve Germany. With the token approval, Rommel successfully usurped Speidel's leadership position in a bloodless coup.\n\nIn Rommel's radio adress to the nation, he called for peace and order, reassuring his citizens that the Greater German Reich will not \"repeat Germany's previous mistakes by enacting petty actions that the Führer despised.\""

While rumours about his distaste for Hitler have existed since the 1948 Coup, Adolf Hitler and the former administration could not find any links between Canaris and the conspirators, which meant that Canaris was spared and continued his operations in the Abwehr.\n\nAs the Reichspräsident, Canaris' presidency might be forgettable. But his inoffensiveness nature might be his best quality, the perfect balance between reforms and orthodox politics."

After Hans Speidel enacted the most influential policy of his reign, Reichspräsident Canaris and Hans Oster, Chief of the Abwehr and lead conspirator took this as a chance to peacefully overthrow the current regime to allow an even more moderate direction.\n\nHans Oster was appointed by Reichspräsident Canaris as the Transitional Chancellor. In the meantime, Oster has also formed a cabinet of like-minded individuals (including a Social Democrat), promising to lead Germany back onto the correct path."

Seeing this as the only viable route to justify Canaris and Oster's actions, the government has released thousands of documents, detailing the true horrors of the Hitler regime.\n\nWhile most people are secretly aware of the dealings of the Reich, it was unheard of for officials to give clear confirmations, until now. This tactic was highly effective, as opposition to the reformist tide lost all of its political and moral leverage."

For years, von Tresckow has been turned into a scapegoat for Nazi propaganda, becoming a constant burden for his living relatives and associates.\n\nHowever, the government has issued posthumous pardons to most of the conspirators of 1948, declaring that Henning von Tresckow was one of Germany's first \"righteous among the nation\". Other notable figures that were pardoned includes Ludwig Beck and Georg Thomas, two prominent figures of the conspiracy. However, Albrecht Becker was not pardoned."
