  IDE_The_General_Strike_Begins:0 "The General Strike Begins"
  IDE_The_General_Strike_Begins_desc:0 "The declaration of martial law across the state has resulted in a… less than favourable response from the workers. Instead of sending the seething proletariat back to their place, martial law has bolstered their resolve to fight against both the lack of worker representation and German dominance over the economy. The strike although initially encompassing only the oil workers has now expanded to include transport workers, miners, construction workers and the list only continues to grow. \n\nAlready the general strike has paralysed the economy and our German beneficiaries are growing impatient as trains carrying pitiful amounts of oil ground to a halt across the nation. If the Tartar state in its current form is to survive then we must put an end to this, and all future strikes, in a brutal wave of repression that shall forever teach the worker their place in our state!."
  IDE_The_Workers_Wont_Win:0 "The Workers Won't Win!"
  IDE_The_Workers_Wont_Win_desc:0 "The strikes widespread effect on our economy has mandated that we take some… drastic methods in order to resolve the situation. In order to deal with these labour shortages Sadri Maksudi Arsal has established the department of labour relations. The new department will help us in not only reestablishing the bond between state and worker but should also create new innovative solutions to ensure that our government never again has to go through a crisis like this. \n\nIn order to ensure that the new department can work to the best of its ability they have been granted certain executive powers to ensure that they don't have to go through the cumbersome mire of red tape in order to bring an end to the strike."
  IDE_Establish_the_Anti_Strike_Work_Force:0 "Establish the Anti-Strike Workforce"
  IDE_Establish_the_Anti_Strike_Work_Force_desc:0 "Although the strikers believe that they hold the full support of the worker they neglect to realise that the social contract between a company and its workers is ultimately one in their favour. After all, how long will they be able to tighten their belts until they come crawling back to us begging for their wages. There have already been a group of right-minded workers, cruelly named ‘scabs' by the leaching strikers,  who have come to understand this and have publically come out in support of the government. \n\nThe department of labour relations has begun reaching out to these patriotic workers in order to properly organise them into the Tartar labour front, an entirely government controlled union.. While being only a fraction of those currently on strike, these new work teams should allow us to at least begin getting the trains moving once again."
  IDE_Higher_Pay_for_those_Willing_to_Work:0 "Higher Pay for those Willing to Work"
  IDE_Higher_Pay_for_those_Willing_to_Work_desc:0 "The ‘scabs' have proven themselves invaluable to us in getting the cogs of Idel-Ural turning once more however they are not enough. Public construction projects proceed at a snail's pace and the lack of oil exports is starting to cause friction between us and our German allies. For these reasons the department of labour relations have deemed it fit to order a general pay raise for all members of the TLF. While the strikers are forced to subsist on bread and water, TLF members will be driving their new cars through the streets. In time the effects of jealousy should peel some strikers away from their precious unions and bring them back into our welcoming arms."
  IDE_Infiltrate_the_Unions:0 "Infiltrate the Unions"
  IDE_Infiltrate_the_Unions_desc:0 "There is no institution that has played a larger role in causing this crisis than the unions, their leadership and monetary reserves have also given the workers the resources the capability to carry on this charade. No longer shall this be permitted. Informants shall be seeded within the unions, rats shall be scouted out and recruited and with this information wherever they try to protest there shall be armed police waiting and wherever their leaders hide we shall find them. The Unions cannot win if there own ranks are with us!"
  IDE_Establish_Anti_Protest_Laws:0 "Establish Anti-Protest Laws"
  IDE_Establish_Anti_Protest_Laws_desc:0 "Prior to the general strike protests were granted to the people as a courtesy. Naturally there never were any, those who tried to organise them were ‘persuaded' to rethink their opinion of the government. It was clear to us from the strikes very beginning that we would be unable to bring the strikers around to our side and as such the people have forsaken this courtesy. \n\nWith the new 1952 Public Safety Act passed protesting during a time of emergency has been deemed illegal and as detrimental and potentially damaging to the future of the Tartar people. With the legal greenlight our police force should now be able to move in wherever a protest materialises disperse it and arrest all those involved."
  IDE_Open_Doors_to_Foreign_Workers:0 "Open Doors to Foreign Workers"
  IDE_Open_Doors_to_Foreign_Workers_desc:0 "Before the strike our government, in regards to immigration, operated on the principal of Tartar first. All potential migrants were heavily screened and were only permitted entrance if they had a skill set proving themselves to be a capable and useful member of society. With the general strike on however a new opportunity presents itself to not only acquire a larger workforce but to also weaken the resolve of the strikers. The department of labour relations has proposed a general opening up of the border to both German and Slavic migrants, if we were to follow through with this policy it would no doubt result in large amounts of unemployment within the native Tartar population and that is precisely what we need. If you don't get back to work then we can just get someone to do it cheaper."
  IDE_Contracts_with_German_Companies:0 "Contracts with German Companies"
  IDE_Contracts_with_German_Companies_desc:0 "Although slavery within Idel-Ural is officialy illegal there is a legal loophole within our constitution that states that prisoners may be subjected to slavery as a punishment for severe crimes. With the extensive amount of prisoners repurposed for slave labour various German companies such as Krupp, Volkswagen and IG farben have come to us proposing a ‘labour exchange program'. In essence we will be trading off some of our prisoner population in exchange for money. Some may argue that it's immoral but it does allow us to make some money off of these strikers."
  IDE_If_not_Man_then_Woman_and_Child:0 "If not Man, then Woman and Child"
  IDE_If_not_Man_then_Woman_and_Child_desc:0 "The people affected worse by the strike have undoubtedly been those members of our society who have been delegated to a household role; wives, sons and daughters have been left without food on their table thanks to the rampant sloth of the strikers. The department of labour relations have benevolently decided to remedy the situation by abolishing a number of old sexist and ageist labour laws that prevented large swathes of our potential workforce from participating in the economy. Now all members of our great state will be able to provide for themselves."
  IDE_Martial_Law_in_Every_Workplace:0 "Martial Law in Every Workplace"
  IDE_Martial_Law_in_Every_Workplace_desc:0 "Workers are now beginning to trickle back into the factories with the measures we took now starting to fully take effect. A report submitted by the department of labour relations however states that we must still remain on guard, many of the former strikers still hold onto their Marxist views and as such present a constant danger to our regime. Pyotr Gavrilov has proposed that ,in order to prevent industrial sabotage by underground socialisct groups, the military be granted permission to place industrial commissars across all significant industrial workplaces in order to ensure that the Marxists do not emerge again."
  IDE_Crush_the_Unions:0 "Crush the Unions"
  IDE_Crush_the_Unions_desc:0 "The time has come to remove the obstacle of unions entirely and absorb all forms of worker representation into the Tartar Labour Front. We have been able to weaken any remaining political support that they had and any potential hotspots for unrest in the aftermath of this decision have been taken care of by both the police and military."
  IDE_Slavery_for_those_who_Protest:0 "Slavery for those who Protest!"
  IDE_Slavery_for_those_who_Protest_desc:0 "Our shakey laws regarding slavery has allowed our government to make some use of those strikers and protesters we have sucsessfully apprehended however leading economicsts within the department of labour relations have suggested that a possible expansion of our forced labour operations may go a long way in turning our economy around. Of course it would be ludicrous to fully legalise slavery however if we were to enforce harsher punishments for petty crimes then it would be easy for us to operate under the pretence that these individuals are paying back their debt to society. \n\nThe first major target for this new policy will of course by both strikers and protesters, their activities have already been largely illegalised. In attempting to take away the productivity of the state they shall instead toil in service for it."
  IDE_We_Rule_This_Country:0 "We Rule This Country!"
  IDE_We_Rule_This_Country_desc:0 "The strikers assume that because they endeavour to strike out against the regime, that society itself shall uproot itself in order to fight alongside them. They are mistaken. In our mission to eternally secure the Tartar people we shall utilise all the resources at our disposal: the police, the military, the media all aimed directly against the strikers."
  IDE_The_Worker_Police:0 "The Worker Police"
  IDE_The_Worker_Police_desc:0 "In order to counteract the strikers and their bolshevik allies properly, a new branch of the police ,known as the department of national stability, shall be formed in order to arrest and detain any and all strikers who the government has deemed to be ‘troublesome'. This new department will be given extensive powers in order to combat the red threat, for one they will be able to detain individuals that the unit sees fit to, they shall also be permitted to hold suspects for an indefinite amount of time without trial. \n\nAll aspects and branches of the government have come out in favour of the proposed department and they shall soon be deployed onto the streets and we shall all sleep a little safer."
  IDE_Burn_the_Bolshevik_Newspapers:0 "Burn the Bolshevik Newspapers"
  IDE_Burn_the_Bolshevik_Newspapers_desc:0 "For as long as Idel-Ural has existed, the government has understood the necessity of keeping a tight grip over what the people see and here. The government owned and only legal newspaper: The Ural vanguard is an exemplary example of fair and factual journalism yet it appears that the facts are not something the strikers like to consider when aspousing their propaganda. The underground presses that the strikers have set up are a key part of their scheme to bring the nation to its knees by turning the Tartar people against their own state! \n\nLuckily for us their are quite a few rats ready to flee the striker's sinking ship. These informants have given us not only the locations of these underground printing presses but also the names of those involved. The department of national stability should be able to clear up these enclaves of treason and have the flow of knowledge once again put under the firm guidance of the government.!"
  IDE_Imprison_the_Workers_Party:0 "Imprison the Workers Party"
  IDE_Imprison_the_Workers_Party_desc:0 "The Idel-Ural worker's party is the striker's political branch and is a key force in organising the strikes and protests. It's clear to the department of national stability that not only has the upper leadership of the Idel-Ural worker's party met, on more than one occasion, with NKVD agents but they have also been involved with the assasination of several lower ranking government ministers [See the 1952 Department of national stability report on ‘troublesome' or potentially subversive ministers for more information]. \n\nWith such clear evidence of the worker's party's treason, orders shall be given to arrest and dispose of Gabdulkhay Akhatov, Sara Sadíqova and Färit Yarullin as well as any other members of the worker's party who has too closely with these individuals. With the head gone the body shall soon rot."
  IDE_No_Speech_for_those_who_Protest:0 "No Speech for those who Protest!"
  IDE_No_Speech_for_those_who_Protest_desc:0 "The protesters and strikers alike have brought our nation into untold amounts of danger. By forsaking the wise and guidance leadership of Sadri Maksudi Arsal these subversive elements have weakened our united front against the Soviets and Transvolgans alike! In this way they have put the safety of the entire Tartar people at risk but no longer. The government has decreed that during this period of national emergency that to protest in support of the strikers is now a capital offence and those caught doing it shall face the harshest possible punishments. There shall be no place in our society for those who threaten the state itself."
  IDE_The_Economy_Above_the_Worker:0 "The Economy Above the Worker!"
  IDE_The_Economy_Above_the_Worker_desc:0 "The general strike has forced us to re-examine our overall economic policy as well as presenting the necessity to bring in some bright new ideas in terms of how we manage the country. It's become clear to us that from this point forward we will need to keep a far tighter control over the populace however in order to do so we will need to enlist the aid of one of our nation's largest powerbrokers: the corporations. \n\nIn order to help integrate corporate interests into the government the department of economic management shall be created in order to screen petitions from companies and implement them in return for certain favours."
  IDE_Bread_for_those_who_Cooperate:0 "Bread for those who Co-Operate"
  IDE_Bread_for_those_who_Cooperate_desc:0 "There are some strikers who have fallen into such poverty since the strike that they would be readily willing to turn their back on their fellow strikers and unionists in exchange for the smallest bit of financial aid. The abundance of these sorts of individuals and our corporate allies' need for labour has sparked an idea within the department of economic management. The 1952 welfare act will ensure that our most impoverished citizens will be cared for however as a prerequisite to receive the aid these individuals must swear off all anti-government partisan organisations and swear allegiance to the great leader Sadri Maksudi Arsa. \n\nOf course the strikers are already decrying the act as a thinly veiled attempt to weed out the weak and have labeled those who take the aid provided by the act as ‘Түбән фидерлар' (bottom feeders). They may keep their honour for now, but honour cannot fill an empty stomach."
  IDE_Camps_for_those_who_Resist:0 "Camps for those who Resist"
  IDE_Camps_for_those_who_Resist_desc:0 "With the new influx of prisoners coming into our arms since the general strike erupted we have been hard pressed to actually find places in which we can store them. The new relationship we have decided to pursue with our nation's corporate interests may have presented a solution. Across the nation new labour camps ,similar to the ones the Germans themselves constructed, will be built and upon completion the department of economic management will begin selling these camps off to the highest bidder not only allowing us to get a rapid injection of cash into our budget but it should also grant our corporations a source of cheap and readily available labour all but guaranteeing their future support."
  IDE_The_New_State_Oligarchy:0 "The New State Oligarchy"
  IDE_The_New_State_Oligarchy_desc:0 "Our benevolent leader Sadri Maksudi Arsa has nobly guided the state for many years now, he has shouldered the dangerous responsibility of leadership entirely upon himself and for that we are eternally grateful. Now though things are starting to change fast, money is being exchanged, favours are being traded in and old Arsa knows it. In exchange for the many favours they have done for him the great leader has decided to create an ‘advisory' council filled with the most powerful oligarchs within the country. So let us raise a glass to Sadri Maksudi Arsa and perhaps even more importantly his new advisors!
  IDE_No_Workers_Rights:0 "No Workers Rights"
  IDE_No_Workers_Rights_desc:0 "After all this time there still remains a number of laws permitting the existence of unions, a relic from Sadri Maksudi Arsa's early populist years. It's clear to us that these relics must be torn down. From now on the gap between worker and employer shall be no more, whenever the worker has an issue they are free to bring it up with their employer and if they refuse then the worker can simply change their career. This new act also just so happens to allow us to round up and arrest the last remaining union members."
  IDE_Slave_Trade_with_Germany:0 "Slave Trade with Germany"
  IDE_Slave_Trade_with_Germany_desc:0 "Even though the general strike shall one day be defeated utterly the trust between the people and the government is, perhaps, forever gone. Our economy demands a workforce that we can reliably depend upon and although such a workforce may not be found within our own nation perhaps the answer lies over the border. By purchasing slaves en masse from Germany and then setting them free we will surely gain the eternal loyalty of these people. Of course we won't be paying these people anything close to a livable wage yet that's for us to know and for them to find out."
  IDE_Work_or_Be_Homeless:0 "Work or Be Homeless"
  IDE_Work_or_Be_Homeless_desc:0 "Idel-Ural, as it currently stands, is a backwards nation. It is evident when you look upon our citizens and it is even more so when you look upon our cities which lack the same urban allure as those across the world have. In order to represent how Idel-Ural is a truly modern nation we must redevelop and redesign our cities and in order to do as such the general reconstruction board has been appointed by the great leader himself to oversee the process. The board will be given the powers to evict and seize any homes they deem to be in the way of future development projects. \n\nSome may question the complete lack of budgetary investment into urban reconstruction, the apparent red tape that the whole project has been caught up in and the fact that we seem to be exclusively evicting strikers and unionists yet such people are clearly just obstacles in the path of a new modern Tartar nation."
  IDE_No_Rights_for_Those_who_Protest:0 "No Rights for Those who Protest!"
  IDE_No_Rights_for_Those_who_Protest_desc:0 "Until now protesters have received the same legal classification as any other criminal, they are given a ‘fair' yet public trial and are then carted off to either toil away on the outskirts of the nation or are sent to rot in one of our many camps. Now however it is clear to us that the protesters are a far greater threat to us then we previously thought, by refusing to work they weaken our great economy and by protesting they weaken our society's cohesion and in such a dangerous region as Russia the necessity of a strong united nation cannot be understated. \n\nTherefore all protestors are to be legally classified as terrorists. Once we get our hands on them it is nobody's business except our own of what is done to them and in order to get what we want from them any technique we deem fit shall be employed."
  IDE_The_Workers_Have_Been_Crushed:0 "The Workers Have Been Crushed"
  IDE_The_Workers_Have_Been_Crushed_desc:0 "After all this the task we set ourselves has finally been completed. Our nation's economy has surpassed even it's pre-strike levels and with the trade with Germany booming it seems as though economic growth will be the theme of the decade! The social contract between government and workers has also been reestablished, whenever a man, woman or child dares to walk out from the factory then they can soon expect the lash across their back. \n\nThe strike is now behind us and any threat from the people is out of the question. Yet perhaps change will come anyways, after all Sadri Maksudi Arsa is getting awfully old and behind his back the council of advisors schemes while they nod and smile. Yet that is for the future for now let us celebrate the glorious new Tartar state!"

  idelural.1.t:0 "The First Complaints"
  idelural.1.d:0 "In the oil fields of Orenburg, a few teams of workers have begun to complaint against their bosses for their bad working conditions and their miserable pay. While some have just sorted to complaining, a team of workers decided to shut down the machinery of the oil rig and halt production. \n\nSuch acts will not be accepted in Idel Ural!"
  idelural.1.a:0 "Fire the Strikers!"
  idelural.2.t:0 "Oil Workers Protest in Orenburg"
  idelural.2.d:0 "Since we fired the oil workers who shut down the machinery, more and more workers followed in their footsteps, declaring strike after strike, causing more and more production numbers to fall. This has begun having an effect on our already fragile economy and if it continues, it will begin to have devastating effects. We ought to prevent more workers from getting such ideas but is it worthy to fight it with steel?"
  idelural.2.a:0 "Supress it by all means!"
  idelural.2.b:0 "Wait it out"
  idelural.3.t:0 "Workers Seize Oil Refinery"
  idelural.3.d:0 "Despite our police forces doing their best work to suppress the protests and put workers back into work, it seems it wasnt enough. Now, the workers have armed themselves and occupied a whole oil plant. This will not pass and the army has already been mobilised to deal with this issue."
  idelural.3.a:0 "Send the Army to get those bastards out!"
  idelural.4.t:0 "Peaceful Protests Continue"
  idelural.4.d:0 "By letting the protestors scot-free they still seem to continue to protest for their working conditions. Production is continuing to get lower and lower and its beginning to become more and more concerning. But maybe, they will tire themselves out if we don't intervene."
  idelural.4.a:0 "Let them get it all out of their system"
  idelural.5.t:0 "Strikes Expand into the Whole of Orenburg"
  idelural.5.d:0 "The damned workers begin to fight us more and more. Despite our success in regaining the oil plant, the whole region of Orenburg has declared a general strike in all sectors and forms, even getting a few men from the army and police to their side. The whole region is beginning to fall apart and order is something that is being forgotten."
  idelural.5.a:0 "Send all Forces to establish Order!"
  idelural.6.t:0 "The Night of Class War"
  idelural.6.d:0 "In the night, everything was quiet. Having restored some form of order in Orenburg, the region had calmed down and a common soldier would think that the worse had ended. But that was the furthest from the truth. \n\nBearing guns, hammers, knifes and any sort of weapons they could find, special teams of the workers entered the city of Orenburg and headed towards the houses of the bosses and aristocracy. There, in the middle of absolute peace and quiet, they broke doors and windows down, entering the houses, beating up and killing the men of economic power while they looted their houses dry. The whole of the city went ablaze as they threw firebombs into the houses of the rich. \n\nA new class war started."
  idelural.6.a:0 "Establish Martial Law"
  idelural.7.t:0 "Victory or Death Yelled the Strikers"
  idelural.7.d:0 "In the streets of all cities around our nation, the workers have taken to the streets with arms and banners. Their one single slogan, 'Victory or Death' echoes with every step and every shout through the roads of Kazan. Thousands of workers head towards the capital building with soldiers and police men standing in fear towards the huge crowds. Things are spiralling out of control..."
  idelural.7.a:0 "We must act or we are doomed!"
  idelural.8.t:0 "The General Strike"
  idelural.8.d:0 "What we feared was made into reality. The workers of our nation have spontaneously declared a general nationwide strike with no definite ending. Our economy has gone into the gutter and our reserves are emptying out. The Germans are breathing down our neck while the Soviets drool over our weak state. It is no longer effective to try to be reasonable, we have no choice left. \n\nIt is time the worker learns where he belongs!"
  idelural.8.a:0 "As Serfs to their lords!"
  idelural.9.t:0 "Formation of the Syndicate of Oil Workers"
  idelural.9.d:0 "With the protests picking up speed and more and more people striking, the Oil Workers gathered and formed the Syndicate of Oil Workers, the first workers union outside of state control. They demand better working conditions as they keep radicalising more and more workers to their cause. But it is but a powerless organisation we don't even recognise."
  idelural.9.a:0 "Organisation never hurt anyone"
  idelural.10.t:0 "The Black March"
  idelural.10.d:0 "The streets of Kazan were covered in moving waves of black. Oil workers covered in oil and soot marched towards the government building of Orenburg, waving black flags and the flag of the Oil Syndicate. Despite the threat they could pose, though, for now they seem to keep calm and within the lines of the law. Hopefully, they will not pose any great threat."
  idelural.10.a:0 "Oil stains are so hard to remove..."
  idelural.11.t:0 "Liberty, Rights and Bread Yelled the Strikers"
  idelural.11.d:0 "The peaceful actions of our government seem to have backfired upon us. Workers all over the country are protesting, demanding bread, liberty and their rights from our government. They expect us to give up our absolute power! Well, this is what you tell them!"
  idelural.11.a:0 "They can take their demands and stuff them!"
  idelural.11.b:0 "We must appease the people for our own sake"
