CAN_quebec_regionalism:0 "Quebec Regionalism"
CAN_quebec_regionalism_desc:0 "Quebec has always been a unique part of Canada. French Canadians in Quebec are actively trying to distance themselves with their English-speaking counterparts, creating a strong sense of regionalism in the Quebec region, which in turn might lead to a new wave of Quebecois nationalism in the future."

Canada's location also makes it a viable trading nation, with the benefits of having the immense economy of the United States as their next door neighbour and close ally."

#### Focuses ####
CAN_Army_Start:0 "The Canadian Armed Forces"
CAN_Army_Start_desc:0 "The Royal Canadian Army is the army branch of our armed forces. Having distinguished itself in the Great War, the wars of the 1940s and other conflicts around the world, it's imperative that we continue to update our forces for the uncertain future that awaits us."
CAN_Army_Offensive:0 "Canada on the Offensive"
CAN_Army_Offensive_desc:0 "As an independent and revered nation, we should begin acting like one. Alongside our brave allies in the Toronto Accord, we will take the initiative on the beaches and the streets of oppressed peoples everywhere!"
CAN_Army_C_Force:0 "Legacy of the 'C' Force"
CAN_Army_C_Force_desc:0 "The C Force were amongst the first Canadian troops to see action in the war against Japan, valiantly defending the city of Hong Kong. In a tragic set of circumstances, this ragtag battalion of undertrained and under-equipped men were overrun and slaughtered. We must learn from this mistake, and our high command recommends further professionalization and logistical reforms."
CAN_Army_ExpForce:0 "Bolstering the Canadian Expeditionary Forces"
CAN_Army_ExpForce_desc:0 "On deployment to other parts of the world, Canadian Expeditionary Forces provide the backbone of our contribution to allied efforts. Our forces should be prepared for more future overseas deploymants so they have the necessary fighting ability and logistical infrastructure to hold their own."
CAN_Army_Scheme_One:0 "Revising Defense Scheme #1"
CAN_Army_Scheme_One_desc:0 "The original Defence Scheme 1 was a war plan in the event of an American invasion, meant to delay an invading force as long as possible until British assistance arrives. This is no longer relevant for the current geopolitical situation, as America is a close ally and Canada's greatest threat now lies across the ocean in the form of totalitarian Nazism. This war plan should be modified to hold off an invading force on our eastern seaboard for as long as possible until American assistance arrives."
CAN_Army_Vimy:0 "The Ghosts of Vimy"
CAN_Army_Vimy_desc:0 "We had gone into the Great War as British North Americans, but we left it as Canadians. We will never forget the brave lives that were lost in the trenches of northern France, and the legacy of their great sacrifices will continue to shape our message of national unity and cooperation for years to come!"
CAN_Army_Rangers:0 "Modernized Canadian Rangers"
CAN_Army_Rangers_desc:0 "The Canadian Rangers are among the most prestigious of our armed forces, acting primarily as dispersed scouts that can live off the land and engage in guerrilla tactics if needed. Bringing this elite force into the modern age with new equipment and training will bring nothing but gains for our new army."
CAN_Army_Defense:0 "Bolstering the Home Defense"
CAN_Army_Defense_desc:0 ""
CAN_Army_Warning:0 "Build the Earlier Warning Lines"
CAN_Army_Warning_desc:0 ""
CAN_Army_VetGuard:0 "Reinforcing the Veteran Guard"
CAN_Army_VetGuard_desc:0 "We've many battle-hardened veterans from the war in Japan, veterans we can learn a great deal from. By bringing these experienced men back into the army as advisors, we can improve on the tactics of old."
CAN_Army_ACD:0 "Commence American-Canadian Defense"
CAN_Army_ACD_desc:0 ""
CAN_Army_Warning_Exp:0 "Expand the Earlier Warning Lines"
CAN_Army_Warning_Exp_desc:0 ""
CAN_Army_MCL:0 "Mid-Canada Line"
CAN_Army_MCL_desc:0 ""
CAN_Retire_Lee_Enfield:0 "Retiring the Lee-Enfield"
CAN_Retire_Lee_Enfield_desc:0 "The Lee-Enfield rifle has served our army and other commonwealth nations well over the years, but frankly, it's outdated. While it is a reliable bolt-action rifle, that alone won't do with the nature of modern warfare. We will have to sideline the rifle in favour of more modern assault rifles."
CAN_Copy_American_Tanks:0 "Copy American Tank Designs"
CAN_Copy_American_Tanks_desc:0 "Our southern neighbours are the foremost expert in armoured warfare in the entire Toronto Accord, an opportunity we'd be fools to pass up on. We should get in contact with the American army high command and request the blueprints of tanks used in their fearsome armoured brigades, so that we can build them here in Canada."
CAN_Grizzlies:0 "Modernized Grizzlies"
CAN_Grizzlies_desc:0 "The Grizzly is our primary medium tank, a modified M4A1 design taken from the Americans during the last war. With Canada's military role expanding out to international conflicts more than ever before, we need more than just a battle tank. By creating an armoured personnel carrier under the same name, we can expand the range and utility of our motorized brigades to outmaneuver the enemy in terrain that tanks would never dare lay their tracks in."
CAN_Health_Services:0 "The Health Services Group"
CAN_Health_Services_desc:0 "The role of the field hospital on a battlefield is just as important if not more so than the role of the generals laying out battle plans. By operating on and saving the lives of our brave soldiers injured in battle, they can go and fight another day. Field medics and army surgeons have mostly been integrated into the army directly in the past, but such an important role can't be sidelined any longer. By creating the Canadian Army Health Services Group, we can set up mobile field hospitals close to the front lines and save lives in a timely and efficient manner."
CAN_British_Arms:0 "Purchasing British Arms"
CAN_British_Arms_desc:0 "As the temperature in Europe and elsewhere continues to rise, the call for rearmament rises. Part of the military budget should then go to purchasing arms from our longest-running suppliers, the British. It would be shameful if we could not provide a gun for every recruit, after all."
CAN_Vigilamus_Pro_Te:0 "Vigilamus Pro Te"
CAN_Vigilamus_Pro_Te_desc:0 "Canada is our home and native land, and our army, the finest in the world, shall stand on guard for it. At home and abroad, the Canadian soldier is respected as not only a highly disciplined weapon of war, but a benevolent keeper of peace. With God's grace, the future will be very bright for our brave men and women fighting in the cause of upholding the ideas of freedom both at home and abroad."

CAN_Navy_Start:0 "The Royal Canadian Navy"
CAN_Navy_Start_desc:0 "The royal canadian navy: The navy is an extremely vital branch of the armed forces, projecting our seas and aiding our allies abroad in wartime. Its importance cannot be understated, so perhaps we should look into refitting it."
CAN_Navy_Reserves:0 "Review of the Reserve Ships"
CAN_Navy_Reserves_desc:0 "The Reserve Navy is a relic of the past, to say the least. A significant portion of the fleet are old and outdated rusted trash heaps. We should review the performance of every ship in the fleet and begin plans for modernizing them, lest we fall behind the rest of the world."
CAN_Navy_Helicopters:0 "The Introduction of Ship-Borne Helicopters"
CAN_Navy_Helicopters_desc:0 "Chief Admiral Harry Dewolf has come up with a brilliant suggestion in how to further utilize the capability of the fleet. These so-called "helicopters" can take off and land on the platforms of an aircraft carrier and not take as much space as reconaissance planes. He suggests the implementation of highly skilled helicopter crews to be integrated into the navy for the purpose of improving reconnaissance in combat situations. How can we possibly turn such a brilliant man's plan down?"
CAN_Navy_Bombers:0 "Naval Bombers"
CAN_Navy_Bombers_desc:0 "Our naval observers have keenly noted what did and did not work in the last war, and one particularly noteworthy point was the value of naval bombers. Being able to drop an explosive payload onto enemy ships with terrifying accuracy, they had become especially useful in the Pacific War against Japan. We should implement modernized naval bombers to work for the navy, to further increase its combat effectiveness."
CAN_Navy_Destroyers:0 "Introduce St. Laurent Destroyers"
CAN_Navy_Destroyers_desc:0 "The destroyer is probably the most important of all ships in a modern navy. While it can pack a small but significant punch in direct conflicts with other ships, it is perhaps most valuable in the realm of maritime interdiction. Given the current naval capabilities of nations who remain hostile towards democracy, the need to create a new class of destroyers to better deal with a new age of naval warfare is clear."
CAN_Navy_Production:0 "Expand our Dockyards"
CAN_Navy_Production_desc:0 "There is a growing call for rearmament amongst many of our politicians, as other parts of the world may find themselves in conflicts that may require our involvement. To this end, a naval rearmament program will begin effective immediately to further increase the size of our navy."
CAN_Navy_Carrier:0 "Purchase an Aircraft Carrier"
CAN_Navy_Carrier_desc:0 "Canada has over the past couple of years experienced incredible economic growth coming out of the great depression and subsequent wars. Our allies in the meantime have difficulty making ends meet due to internal issues, especially our good friends in London. We should ask to purchase one of their older aircraft carriers so that we may grow our fleet further, and to alleviate the economic woes of a Toronto Accord ally."
CAN_Navy_ASW:0 "A New Age of Anti-Submarine Warfare"
CAN_Navy_ASW_desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine; the name alone had captivated the attention and fear of the west during the last war. But what we learned from the conflict was how important the protection of shipping was against predatory U-Boats. We should review our last conflict with the German navy, for if (or perhaps, when) another war breaks out, we stand prepared having learned from our mistakes."
CAN_Navy_Interdiction:0 "Maritime Interdiction for a New Age"
CAN_Navy_Interdiction_desc:0 "The doctrine of maritime interdiction has served the navy well for the past couple years, however many of our tactics might also not be up to speed with modern ships. Canadians have learned all too well in 1914 what going into a conflict with an outdated mindset can do, and would not want such a tragic mistake to ever happen again. We must evaluate the strategic planning capabilities of our finest officers and bring them to the modern age."
CAN_Navy_Final:0 "Parati vero parati"
CAN_Navy_Final_desc:0 "The Canadian Royal Navy stands as a moving force in the world, able to stand alongside other champions of democracy and fight valiantly in its noble cause. Ready Aye Ready is our motto, and by the grace of God almighty we shall be!"

CAN_Air_Start:0 "The Royal Canadian Air Force"
CAN_Air_Start_desc:0 "The air force is an important and prestigious branch of our armed forces, having distinguished itself in the last war. We should begin preparing it for the next one, so we may fly as equals alongside our allies once again."
CAN_Air_Coordination:0 "Battlefield Coordination"
CAN_Air_Coordination_desc:0 "The German blitzkrieg across Europe stunned army commanders across the world with its speed and devastating effectiveness, having conquered Europe from France to Arkhangelsk. What we've learned from this war was the importance of air superiority is that direct assistance in ground combat is extremely effective. We should adapt this into the general air force stratagem."
CAN_Air_Paratroopers:0 "Modernizing the Paratroopers"
CAN_Air_Paratroopers_desc:0 "Our paratroopers are nothing short of an incredibly brave and esteemed branch of the air force, able to operate far behind enemy lines and take important objectives against the odds. We should train our paratroopers in the art of modern warfare for the wars to come."
CAN_Air_Blitz:0 "Lessons From The Blitz"
CAN_Air_Blitz_desc:0 "The RCAF briefly participated in skirmishes in Europe alongside our English friends, a brief but enlightening experience. Although it ended up being for little as we were forced to sign an armistice with the Germans, our air crews learned a great deal in the world of dogfighting. We should take the lessons learned from the fights that we won and lost, lest we be forced to sign yet another humiliating treaty with the enemy."
CAN_Air_Canadair:0 "Commission Canadair"
CAN_Air_Canadair_desc:0 "Canadair is the foremost aircraft manufacturer in Canada, an extremely wealthy and talented company that we've come to rely on over the years. We must now call on them again, this time to commission a new class of transport planes. Our air force high command predicts that any future conflict could see them becoming extremely useful in civil and military applications alike, there's nothing to lose by throwing money at an all-Canadian company to design truly Canadian aircraft."
CAN_Air_TA:0 "The Toronto Accord Air Training Plan"
CAN_Air_TA_desc:0 "The government has an ingenious plan to strengthen the Toronto Accord alliance while improving the capabilities of the air force; an inter-alliance training program aimed at training pilots from across the alliance on the finest grounds of them all, right here at home. If they accept, it'll be beneficial for all. "
CAN_Air_Home_Defense:0 "Reinforce the Home Defense"
CAN_Air_Home_Defense_desc:0 "The home defence is important for Canada's security, and we must be ready for any threat that may come our way. Herr Goering mocks us by claiming the Luftwaffe can reach as far as Toronto, but we can prove him wrong. By improving our response capabilities to incoming threats from the air, not one plane will reach our fair domain!"
CAN_Air_Final:0 "Per ardua ad astra"
CAN_Air_Final_desc:0 "To the stars! That is the motto of our airforce. Through adversity, the great fighters of Canada rule the skies like no other nation does. The stars look kindly down on our brave fighters, just as the gods of old once did. The Royal Canadian Air Force is like no other in the world, come shall what may!"

CAN_Start_Liberal_Focus_1_desc:0 "The title of governor-general is largely ceremonial, meant to act as the British monarch’s representative to the royal subjects of Canada. This task has never been undertaken by a Canadian however, and with the changing political climate this has to change. The prime minister will petition London to give our growing nation it’s first Canadian governor-general, to further assert our role in the Commonwealth and the world. "
CAN_Start_Liberal_Focus_2_desc:0 "The Supreme Court is considered to be the highest branch of law in any modern nation-state. Ideally, it is to be impartial in how it upholds the laws we hold so dearly in a democratic society. Unfortunately, it is largely powerless; as litigants in cases can choose to appeal at the Judicial Privy Council situated in London instead. Canada must no longer have people in other countries dictate the most sacred of our institutions, and the Supreme Court of Canada will be made the utmost highest legal authority in our fair domain. "
CAN_Start_Liberal_Focus_3_desc:0 "\"Help those who cannot help themselves.\" This was the famous motto coined by the late prime minister Mackenzie King to create a better Canada for the less-fortunate. Upon succeeding this titan of our times, Louis St. Laurent has promised to continue his legacy through sweeping social welfare reforms. With elections just around the corner, it would be most prudent to extend these reforms to creating a universal pension plan so that our seniors can live out their golden years in happiness instead of anxiety. "
CAN_Start_Starting_Focus_desc:0 "Canada has been a prosperous democracy for a long time now. Who knows what the future could hold?"
CAN_Start_1952_Quebec_Elections_desc:0 "Our attention now turns to the ever-tumultuous Francophone province of Quebec, famous for opposing conscription and their increased demands for rights and equality in Canada. The candidates in the 1952 Quebec elections are certainly colourful folks; the regionalist Union Nationale on the right and the incumbent Liberal Party. Although both sides oppose conscription, the Union Nationale under its leadership of Maurice Duplessis is openly catholic and anticommunist. Should \"Le Chef\" win and shake up the status quo, Quebec may once again be thrown into turmoil."
CAN_Start_1952_Duplessis_desc:0 "Ending Adelard Godbout's eight year premiership, Maurice Duplessis is once again in charge of the Francophone province of Quebec. With the "Grand Noirceur" once again in action, many left wing and liberal groups in Quebec worry that his new term will bring the province into another Great Darkness favouring conservatism over progressivism. But only time will tell what Le Chef's new term will bring."
CAN_Start_1952_Godbout_desc:0 "Having been defeated at the polls once again, Maurice Duplessis has meekly accepted the re-election of Adelard Godbout as Premier of Quebec. Running on a platform of peaceful cooperation with Ottawa and economic/social liberalism, Godbout is expected to continue his previous term's policy of helping Quebec transition to a secular and modernized province in Canada. "
CAN_Start_Union_Crackdown_desc:0 "Premier Duplessis knows that unions are nothing but tools of the communists, used to infiltrate and destroy our great nation, and as such, has ordered a crackdown."
CAN_Start_General_Strike_desc:0 "It appears that many workers do not appreciate being saved from communism, and a general strike has broken out. Premier Duplessis knows that this is nothing but the beginning of a communist revolution against our great nation, and has requested that the PM deploy the army to crush the strike."
CAN_Start_Next_Elections_desc:0 "These next elections will be historic, as global events push Canada’s role as a champion of democracy on par with its strongest allies. The roles of all the establishment parties and the minority populists in parliament are sure to make our position in the next four years an interesting one. All that’s left now is for the next prime minister to be selected by the people themselves. "
CAN_Start_Quiet_Revolution_desc:0 "For years, Quebec premier Adélard Godbout has been radically transforming the Francophone province towards a progressive and liberal future. Being dubbed by outsiders as the “Quiet Revolution”, his unique style of politicking must be continued to bring the province out from the dark ages of Clerical Supremacy reinforced by former-premier Maurice Duplessis."
CAN_Start_Conscription_Deal_desc:0 "History has shown that the Québécois peoples want little to do with what they see as not their wars. As Ottawa appears to act in the interests of the Toronto Accord, most Quebecers are content with a stance of neutrality. If the prime minister can sit down with the anti-conscription premier of Quebec and reach even the slightest compromise, Canada has nothing to lose and everything to gain."

CAN_Oil_Nukes:0 "Project Cauldron"
CAN_Oil_Nukes_desc:0 "American geologists have been trying to find peaceful applications for nuclear energy in the noble cause of peaceful development, however one L.M Latland has proposed a more... radical application. Using American nuclear warheads, underground nuclear detonations would (at least in theory) boil the oil sand deposits so regular methods of oil extraction could be used. Although the thought of using destructive weapons at all is unpalatable to some politicians, the benefits surely outweigh one or two angry politicians..."
CAN_Nuclear_Program_1:0 "Canadian Nuclear Program"
CAN_Nuclear_Program_1_desc:0 "Diplomacy is, unfortunately, not the solution in dealing with totalitarian states. Should they threaten our existence and very way of life, we must be ready. Many of our finest scientists worked with America on the atomic bomb project, and could theoretically apply our growing nuclear industry for military applications. Deterrence is the greatest tool for preserving peace, is it not?"
CAN_Nuclear_Program_2:0 "Utilize the Chalk River Labs"
CAN_Nuclear_Program_2_desc:0 "The Chalk River labs are the forefront of nuclear physics research. We will have to add military capabilities to this currently civilian center, allowing the production of weapons-grade uranium."
CAN_Nuclear_Program_3:0 "The Test"
CAN_Nuclear_Program_3_desc:0 ""And as i saw the blinding light blanket the skies, a large mushroom cloud dominated the once-tranquil tundra. Many of us were speechless as the weight of our actions began to sink in; some laughed, but others cried. And yet, i felt no emotions at all. Is this the new Canada i want my children to grow up in? I don't know anymore. We will have to notify the federal government that the Canadian atom bomb is ready.""

CAN_Oil_Infrastructure_desc:0 "The basic infrastructure in the prairies is... rudimentary at best. The only real mode of transportation is through the Trans-Pacific Railway, and this has to change. To improve the lives of the people living there and to improve the transportation of vital resources there, major infrastructure improvements must be undertaken."
CAN_Oil_Expand:0 "Oilfield Expansion"
CAN_Oil_Expand_desc:0 "Our initial incursions into the Albertan oilsands have been quite successful so far, and the oil companies agree. We should expand our operations further."
CAN_Oil_Expand_More:0 "Continued Expansion"
CAN_Oil_Expand_More_desc:0 "The success of the Canadian petroleum industry is hard to deny, as it readily becomes a larger part of the Canadian economy. For the sake of economic prosperity, we should expand this already large operation even further by inviting foreign companies to drill in Alberta."
CAN_Oil_Science:0 "Refinery Research"
CAN_Oil_Science_desc:0 "Petroleum has many uses that go beyond just fuelling our cars and homes, as it turns out.

CAN_CCF_Initial_3:0 "Support Unions"
CAN_CCF_Initial_1_desc:0 "Not everyone in the government is as enthusiastic about the idea of the radical changes that Coldwell and his supporters propose, so we should meet with the opposition and make token promises to keep them involved in all future proposed bills that we put forth to parliament."
CAN_CCF_Initial_2_desc:0 "Our support base is mainly based in the prairie provinces, and especially in Saskatchewan where Tommy Douglas's provincial CCF government has met resounding success. We should continue to build on our new power bases outside the prairies so the CCF can continue to stand as a political force to be reckoned with in Canada!"
CAN_CCF_Initial_3_desc:0 "One of our main election platforms is our support of Canada's trade unions, a relationship that both Coldwell and David Lewis have cultivated over the years. By meeting the demands of our trade unions, we can improve the lives and working conditions of Canada's working class; something that every Canadian will benefit from."
CAN_CCF_Initial_Victory:0 "Victory for the CCF"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Victory_desc:0 "The Cooperative Commonwealth Federation has emerged victorious in the last round of federal elections, truly an upset for the establishment parties. Running on a social democratic/democratic socialist agrarian platform, the CCF is expected by many to act on their populist ideals and radically reform Canada, for better or worse."
CAN_CCF_Initial_CAA:0 "The Constitutional Reform Act"
CAN_CCF_Initial_CAA_desc:0 "The Canadian constitution, while already a remarkable document upholding our sovereignty and the rights of our people, continues to have one condition that bothers many. We cannot change our own constitution without the explicit permission of London. This is an unacceptable clause that holds our \"Dominion\" back from achieving true independence from its colonial masters, and is proof that the process of Patriation should be expedited. We will propose a bill to parliament that will allow the Canadian government to change its own constitution without having to rely on outdated colonial practices."
CAN_CCF_Initial_Referendum:0 "Referendum on the Monarchy"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Referendum_desc:0 "The British continue to hold a grip on the highest levels of Canadian government, with the \"Governor-General\" holding the highest position of government instead of our Prime Minister. The fact that our Governor-General's purpose to execute the royal prerogative from someone who doesn't even live in Canada or understand its issues is unacceptable, even if it is just symbolic. We will bring a mandate to the people of Canada asking them to take the final step towards patriation and rid ourselves of the colonial past and bring us into a new future, a Canada that is truly strong and free!"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Autocoup:0 "Down with the Queen!"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Autocoup_desc:0 "Enough is enough, the imperialist hold on Canada's government is far too much to bear for our government and the people. Regardless of what the reactionary politicians say about our moves, the time for full independence is now! No longer will Canada's fate be tied to out-of-touch rich foreigners, no longer will Canada be bound to outdated ideas of kings and queens! The British can no longer exert the power over us as they once did, so the time for the Canadian people to control their own destiny is now!"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Flag:0 "The Flag Debate"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Flag_desc:0 "Another unfortunate sign of our past remains the \"Red Ensign\" flag, a sign that Liberals and Quebecois autonomists alike despise. Since we must continue to distance ourselves from the past, we will begin another referendum to decide the new Canadian flag, with the assistance of the Liberal Party."
CAN_CCF_Initial_Monarchy:0 "The Monarchy Remains"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Monarchy_desc:0 "Despite a long and tiresome campaign to convince the Canadian people of the need to remove the last bastions of British control over our country, the people have ultimately decided to maintain the status quo. This is a great embarrassment for Prime Minister Coldwell, who pushed the campaign to the point of advocating revolution. In order to save face, a more moderate candidate is expected to replace Major Coldwell to try and amend ties with the Liberal/Tory establishment."
CAN_CCF_Initial_Republic:0 "Long Live the Republic"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Republic_desc:0 "The people have decided well! We will dismiss the Governor-General and place the Prime Minister of Canada as the true head of state, a true sign of our status as an independent democratic republic! With patriation finally complete, CCF supporters celebrate in the streets as our future looks brighter than ever. Nothing can stop the wave of progressivism washing over our great land, and certainly not budding reactionary demagogues in the army. Vive la Canadienne!"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Ousted:0 "A Moderate Direction"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Ousted_desc:0 "The \"Republican Crisis\" as it's now known has been a disaster for the CCF, and especially for its leader, Major Coldwell. To prevent our government from collapsing and forcing another election campaign on the Canadian people, Coldwell should resign in favour of a more moderate politician in his government. Perhaps through moderate social democracy the legacy of the CCF can be preserved."
CAN_CCF_Initial_Coldwell:0 "Onwards to Socialism"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Coldwell_desc:0 "We've done it, We've made democracy truly work for all Canadians. As a new day dawns on our democratic socialist republic, the time for reform under Major Coldwell is now! We should now begin the process of transitioning the Canadian economy away from liberal capitalism and more towards a state-controlled socialist economy."
CAN_CCF_Initial_Purge:0 "Purge the Military"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Purge_desc:0 "The army humiliated itself with the attempted putsch on the capital. They claimed to be preventing a crypto-communist conspiracy from destroying the social fabric of Canada, but they also forgot which country they're in. We are not like the fascist demagogues in Nazi Germany, and the conspirators are certainly no Von Treskow. We will need to reassign or forcefully retire the conspiring generals who participated in the so-called \"Trenton Coup\" so as to prevent authoritarians from ever tainting our armed forces."
CAN_CCF_Initial_Moderate:0 "The Winnipeg Declaration"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Moderate_desc:0 "In Winnipeg, home of the CCF social-democratic faction, a New Canada is being manifested in the minds and hearts of the party. No longer will Canada have to bear the burden of inequality, poor infrastructure, or public misery. Instead, it will see the light of equality, state planning, and public welfare. Onwards towards Canada! Onwards towards democracy!"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Reformist:0 "The Regina Manifesto"
CAN_CCF_Initial_Reformist:0 "At one of the epicenters of the great depression in Canada, the CCF drafts a vision for the future of Canada. Breaking off with the social-democratic faction of the party, the Regina Manifesto outlines a Canada which is embedded with the merits of both socialism and democracy. Let us be successful in our efforts to rid Canada of the robber barons!"
CAN_CCF_Initial_QuebecSolve:0 "Resolve the Quebec Tensions"
CAN_CCF_Initial_QuebecSolve_desc:0 "The Quebecois are still understandably quite upset with the federal government, after years of sidelining and dismissal of autonomy many budding nationalists still stir fear in them of threats of "Anglo Imperialism". This cannot go on any longer, we're all Canadians after all. We will sit down with Quebec nationalist leaders and hammer out an agreement that will hopefully bring an end to the unrest, at least for now."
CAN_CCF_Both_1:0 "Tax the Rich"
CAN_CCF_Both_1_desc:0 "Through a series of loopholes in the federal tax code, many of the wealthiest Canadians can get away with keeping a great deal more than they are supposed to. By reforming the tax code and closing these loopholes, we can secure much more funds for our future social programs"
CAN_CCF_Both_2:0 "Increased Education Funding"
CAN_CCF_Both_2_desc:0 "Many Canadian public schools, especially those in rural or working class areas, suffer from underfunding and neglect. We must set aside more money in the federal budget for education spending, to ensure that no Canadian student is held back simply because of where they live or how much their family earns."
CAN_CCF_Both_3:0 "Support Public Research"
CAN_CCF_Both_3_desc:0 "The great universities of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver have the potential to be centers of cutting-edge research in North America, but as of now, they have been a bit strapped for funds. We should directly invest in the research efforts of our public universities, in order to help them realise their full potential."
CAN_CCF_Both_4:0 "Increase Electricity Regulations"
CAN_CCF_Both_4_desc:0 "In many areas of the country, particularly more rural areas, electricity coverage is spotty at best. This is a result of the private ownership of the electric grid, leading to neglect and low quality standards. While we cannot nationalize it outright, we can hit the electric companies with more regulations and heftier fines."
CAN_CCF_Both_5:0 "Begin Healthcare Reform"
CAN_CCF_Both_5_desc:0 "The Canadian healthcare system, still largely in private hands, has left many Canadians with inadequate or overly expensive care. In order to resolve this, we must begin to push for a public option."
CAN_CCF_Both_6:0 "Help the Poor"
CAN_CCF_Both_6_desc:0 " Canada's poorest citizens live a near Spartan existence, with almost nowhere to go for support. We must institute a series of relief efforts and support nets in order to support our poorest citizens. No Canadian should go hungry, and no Canadian should go homeless."
CAN_CCF_Both_7:0 "Benefits for the Elderly"
CAN_CCF_Both_7_desc:0 "For many Canadian elders, the last act of life can be a profoundly lonesome and stressful period. In order to better care for our elders, we must invest in homes for the elderly, we must establish a system of senior healthcare, and we must create a Canada where one can live their sunset years in dignity and in peace."
CAN_CCF_Both_8:0 "A Better Canada"
CAN_CCF_Both_8_desc:0 "Through a great deal of work and political struggle, we have achieved the Canada we have always wanted. Our schools are better now, our universities are producing more, and our infrastructure is in a better shape than ever.

CAN_LDR_DREW_DESC:0 "Born and raised in northern Ontario, George Drew studied law shortly before becoming a distinguished officer in the First World War. Becoming a Colonel by the end of the war, Drew was elected mayor of his hometown of Guelph and became an important politician in the Ontario Conservative Party. Climbing through the party ranks first as Premier of Ontario and then leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, Drew became infamous for his red baiting campaigns against CCF politicians and for his inflammatory remarks towards French Canadians. Now against the odds, Drew has been elected as Prime Minister. Will he be able to repair his relationship with Canada's francophone population and bring Canada into a new age after decades of Liberal rule?"
CAN_LDR_DIEF_DESC:0 "Born in Western Ontario, John Diefenbaker was raised in the prairies of the Northwestern Territories. His political ambitions began at a young age,but were never taken seriously by his family. After serving in the First World War, Diefenbaker entered a legal career which soon became a political one. He became one of the leading lights in the local Conservative Party,in a traditionally Liberal region, and became known as a vocal opponent of free trade with the United States- fearing American domination over Canada. Now his hard work has finally paid off- his political successes have led to him becoming Prime Minister. Will he cave in to the mainstream, or will he break American dominance?"
CAN_LDR_LAURENT_DESC:0 "Louis Stephen St. Laurent was born in a Quebec village to bilingual parents. During his time as an accomplished lawyer in Quebec, he became a staunch supporter of the Liberal Party and enamoured with the late politician Wilfrid Laurier. Eventually entering politics in 1941 as a member of Mackenzie King's cabinet as Minister of Justice and later as Minister of External Affairs, he helped gather the nations of the free world into the Toronto Accord; putting Canada on the map in the post-war world. After being selected as leader of the Liberal Party after Mackenzie King's retirement to overwhelming support, he created Canada's first mass-media figure in politics leading him to win a comfortable majority government in 1949 as prime minister. Not hiding his disdain for the authoritarian regimes that now dominate mainland Europe as well as a distaste for communism, St. Laurent is determined to strengthen Canada's position in the world while upholding the ideas of political liberty and internal unity."
CAN_LDR_PEARSON_DESC:0 "Born and raised in Toronto, Lester Pearson graduated from college with an affinity for sociology and history. A distinguished officer during the First World War, Pearson was largely unsure with what to do with his life. Passing the foreign service exam with flying colours, he would enter a career in international politics. Becoming First Secretary of the Canadian High Commission in London in 1935, Pearson's career in foreign affairs became an extremely accomplished one. Becoming Canada's ambassador to the United States in 1945 and later Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1946, Pearson became an extremely influential Liberal politician; being instrumental in the formation of the Toronto Accord. Now as he stands as Prime Minister of Canada, Pearson is an adamant supporter of strengthening Canada's position in the Accord and continuing his predecessor's work of improving the welfare for all Canadians."
CAN_LDR_DOUGLAS_DESC:0 "Thomas Clement Douglas was born in Scotland to a relatively poor family, moving to Winnipeg in 1910. During his childhood, Tommy had become convinced that healthcare should be made free for all after he was treated for a traumatic illness that would've amputated his leg if his family had to pay for the expenses. Witnessing the RCMP kill one of the demonstrators during the Winnipeg General Strike of 1918 firsthand, he became convinced of the need to uphold universal freedoms for all citizens. Studying sociology, theology and socialist economics in university, he later moved to Saskatchewan as a church minister. Joining the CCF on its foundation, he quickly moved through its ranks and became the first democratic socialist premier in Canada; introducing medicare to the province of Saskatchewan. Becoming a popular MP in the House of Commons and later a cabinet minister in the new CCF-lead government, Tommy Douglas has now become Prime Minister. But will he be able to bring his grandiose ideas of nation-wide medicare and universal rights to all Canadians?"
CAN_LDR_LEWIS_DESC:0 "Born as David Losz to Polish Jewish parents, David was exposed from an early age to members of the Jewish Labour Bund; a secular Jewish party that worked in the Russian Empire advocating for socialist policies and the deposition of the Russian Tzar. Leaving for Canada with his family in 1921 to escape the Polish-Soviet war, David Lewis began to work with socialist organizations in Montreal and Nova Scotia. Moving to Great Britain to study law at Lincoln College, Lewis associated himself with multiple socialist circles on campus; frequently getting into fights with BUF Blackshirts. Although Lewis is a vocal anticommunist as per the norm with Bundist thought, his political views are frequently viewed as \"Parliamentary Marxism\". Rejecting an offer to join the British Labour Party and returning to Canada, Lewis became the National Secretary of the CCF in 1935. Believing in forging ties with the country's largest unions, Lewis advocates for a mixed economy in times of peace; citing the success of Mackenzie King's centralized economic planning during the Second World War. Now that he is the leader of the CCF and Canada's first Jewish Prime Minister, will he be able to continue his plans of combatting communist influence and realize the CCF's dreams?"
CAN_LDR_COLDWELL_DESC:0 "Born and raised in England, Major Coldwell moved to Canada when he was 22 to become a teacher in Alberta and later on in Saskatchewan. Creating the Farmer-Labour Party in 1929, Coldwell began making connections within labour and farmer's organizations in the prairies. Becoming the first national secretary of the CCF in 1934, Coldwell regularly clashed with other CCF politicians over Canada's involvement in the Second World War, believing in intervention against the Axis over pacifism. Becoming leader of the CCF in 1942 after J.S. Woodsworth's death, Coldwell continues to uphold the democratic socialist policies on which the party was founded despite fierce red baiting from his Liberal and Tory opponents. Convinced on the need to either abolish capitalism or reform it in Canada, Coldwell's election as North America's first democratic socialist leader has undoubtedly shaken the mainstream political establishment to its core. But will he be able to overcome resistance from the opposition and within his party?"

twrcanada.20.d:0 "For decades, the Dominion of Canada has used the Canadian Red Ensign as its official flag. While it remains popular with most prominent conservatives, many in the Liberal and CCF camps have been calling for a national referendum to decide on a new flag as Canada drifts further away from its colonial past. Citing the changing times of which Canada has an important role in as well as the need to bridge the divide between the French Canadians and Ottawa for a united Confederation, three proposals for Canada's flag have been brought forth to the Prime Minister. The first flag, the so-called "Pearson Pennant" had been drafted by the prominent Liberal politician Lester Pearson; joining three red maple leafs onto one stem occupying a white field, with blue bars on the side. The second flag was created by prominent Canadian historian George Stanley; calling for a simple and recognizable flag, he proposes a single red maple leaf on a white background with red bars on the side. With all three flags (as well as the current Red Ensign) in hand, the referendum goes ahead as planned despite strong Conservative opposition. With the votes counted late into the night, the results are..."

A vague series of legislations that prevent the \"infiltration of communist propaganda in the province of Quebec\", it's been regularly used by the provincial government to crack down on those advocating for the rights of workers (or those that oppose Duplessis' Laissez Faire economics). After securing his re-election, the premier has announced an amendment to the anti-communist legislation; the government's Labour Relations Commission will be authorized to withdraw union certification from any union that it finds guilty of "communist activities". On par with his usual rhetoric, many top union leaders have already strongly condemned the proposed law, accusing him of simply making up a reason to remove his opposition. "

On the strong urging of St. Laurent himself, the premier has agreed to send Union Nationale representatives to sit down with the provincial unions to talk about ending the strike; with federally-sponsored mediators of course. After hours of rather tense negotiations, the Duplessis government has announced an agreement that would bring an end to the strike while also keeping communist sympathizers away from the unions.

[CONSERVATIVE LEADER] went on a fiery tangent on the Liberal's seeming lack of care for the basic right of assembly, going as far as to call Capitol Hill "Little Germania".

Going further in his speech, he accused St. Laurent of acting in the interests of large businesses over the common Canadian people. Upon ending his speech, he was received with a passionate roar from the crowd, later singing the song of the C.C.F.

twrcanada_ccf.6.d:0 "Prime Minister Major Coldwell was unexpectedly called in for a cabinet meeting to "deal with the future of the CCF" this morning. Walking into the meeting, he was greeted only by Hazen Argue, Tommy Douglas and David Lewis; Mr. Coldwell's most trusted MPs. Being accused of being an dangerous extremist attempting to hand Canada over to the communists, Argue has demanded that Coldwell resign as Prime Minister amidst the republican crisis. Reluctantly agreeing to resign in favour of a more moderate politician, this leaves the CCF with two options for a new leader and Prime Minister of Canada. Our first option is Tommy Douglas, a Saskatchewan reverend who brought sweeping social welfare reforms to the province in North America's first democratic socialist government extremely popular throughout the country. Our other option is David Lewis, a powerful democratic socialist MP known for advocating Bundist politics and nationalized economic planning. Ultimately, the new choice for Prime Minister is..."

This morning, three Canadian army divisions marched into the country's capital in an unexpected move to force the new government to resign, under the pretext of \"restoring order\" and \"saving Canada from the Bolshevik menace\". Similar events had taken place across the country. Prime Minister Coldwell authorized the RCMP to move in and disperse the attempted coup, by force if necessary. It was clear that the coup wasn't well planned out, as the RCMP managed to route the rebellious generals. While the remainder of the army appears to remain loyal and commerce centres remain mostly intact, it's evident to Coldwell and the CCF that the old order is a threat to the livelihood of the Canadian worker, and more radical reforms are already being drafted. Officially, the Toronto Accord denies all involvements, but some believe otherwise..."

Upon leaving Parliament Hill, the CCF ministers were promptly arrested by MPs to the background of jeering soldiers. With the Tories returning to Parliament Hill by request of the local brigadier general, it's certain that the new government set up in the coup's wake will be dominated by the Conservatives.

Citing a complete disregard for their interests and the threat of anglification, an independence referendum has passed under Ottawa's watchful eye.

Following days of unrest in the Francophone city of Montreal over increasingly draconian anti-union laws, the Canadian military has been called in on Premier Duplessis' request to put down what he called "communist banditry". Killing 12 and injuring 50, the move has made both the Quebec and Ottawa governments extremely unpopular across the country. As nationwide demonstrations venerating the strikers march in every city, many Québécois politicians are abandoning the established regionalist parties to take a radical sovereigntist stance. After a formal apology condemning Duplessis' actions has been made by the prime minister's office, it's becoming clear that St. Laurent's government won't last very long now."

Running as two separate entities (CBFT and CBLT for French and English programming respectively) the launch was a stunning success. Following a brief message from Prime Minister Laurent greeting the Canadian people over TV for the first time, both stations went ahead with their own programs. While the French station played a translated version of "Aladdin And His Lamp", the English channel played a wonderful rendition of the Leslie Bell Singers. Already, people across the country are clamouring for television sets when the Hockey Night in Canada radio program announced its first television broadcast in late October.

twrcanada.7.d:0 "The past couple days have been tumultuous in the ever-dramatic world of Canadian hockey, but the latest scandal now has current politics thrown into the beloved sport. Star winger of the Montreal Canadiens and Quebecois celebrity Maurice Richard hit a linesman during a fight over an offside call during a game. As a disciplinary action, Richard has been suspended for the rest of the NHL's 1955 season. Believing his punishment to be too severe, Canadiens fans across Montreal took to the streets demanding some leniency for Richard. With the knowledge that the NHL president is an anglo Canadian, these protests took a nationalistic turn when fans accused the NHL for discrimination based on Maurice Richard's Francophone heritage.\n\nFollowing an extremely tense Canadiens game of which the president was in attendance, a riot erupted just outside the stadium between protestors and police, injuring dozens and hundreds more arrested. This particular hockey riot is certainly indicative of Quebec's growing nationalism, as even our most sanctified sport is no longer immune to its ideas."

twrcanada.12.d:0 "Despite believing that the former party leader George A. Drew would lead the Tories to great successes within Federal elections, basing such off of his excellent showings in three successive provincial elections alongside Francophone ridings, hopes were dashed in the 1949 election - with the Progressive Conservatives losing well over 24 seats, leaving them at 41 members in the House of Commons. Eventually, an opportunity presented itself for the party: Drew's formal resignation as both Opposition Leader and head of the party, after a nearly fatal attack from meningitis.\n\nArranged for December, a leadership election has been called today, housed at the Ottawa Coliseum in Ontario. Many delegates within the party voiced their desire for change - to both coalesce into a formidable opposition to the Liberals, and to restore faith and popularity with conservative voters, who'd had animosity to George Drew's many fumbles. With few strong challengers, the winner was already seen far before the final tally. Receiving nominations from both the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Premiers, John Diefenbaker achieved victory within the first vote.\n\nHaving been frustrated by gerrymandering of traditionally Progressive Conservative ridings by the Liberals, and many attempts to unseat him, John Diefenbaker presents himself as a reformer - concentrating on changes to domestic policy, alongside working with the provinces to execute a reform of the Senate. Combined with extensive new agricultural policies, while reducing Canada's dependence on the United States for trade, and reaffirming her ties to the United Kingdom. Despite the Progressive Conservative platform being derided by Louis St. Laurent as being "a mere cream-puff of a thing—with more air than substance", Diefenbaker remained firm in his closing arguments:\n"We must remember where we came from - and what we are here for. The Progressive Conservatives stand for the people who the Liberals glass over with each election. Our farmers, woodworkers, and industrial workers. We are their voice - and we mustn't forget them.""
