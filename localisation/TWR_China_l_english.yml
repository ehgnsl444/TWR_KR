#Description
Chen_Cheng_DESC:0 "Graduating from Baoding Military Academy in 1922, Chen Cheng entered Whampoa Military Academy two years later, meeting Chiang Kai-shek for the first time, then Commandant of the Academy. Later on, Chen joined National Revolutionary Army, which he climbed up the rank structure with flying colours. His successes allowed him to be promoted time and time again, eventually becoming the commander of the 18th Army.\n\nAfter the end of the Second Chinese Civil War, Chen Cheng's close ties with Chiang Kai-shek and his influence within the military landed Chen a favourable position as the Overseer of the Dongbei Authority, a department overseeing the reconstruction and development of former Manchuria.\n\nIn the Northeast, Chen Cheng solidified his power and strengthened his 'Tu Mu' Clique, later cementing his position as the Generalissimo's successor."
Li_Zongren_DESC:0 "Li Zongren started his life as a village boy, later entering military service under Warlord Cai E and graduated from the Guilin Military Cadre Training School, becoming a platoon commander in the army of Guangxi warlord Lu Rongting by 1916.\n\nLi Zongren's rise to power is intertwined with the Old Guangxi Clique and the rise of Kuomintang, later serving as the warlord of Guangxi, administrating the region with great efficiency. At one point, he declared clear opposition against Chiang's rule, even fighting a brief conflict with the Central Government. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Li Zongren distinguished himself with his strong doctrines and military capability. Afterwards, Li Zongren served high positions within the Government, at one point becoming the Vice President, later resigning due to rumoured conflicts with the Generalissimo."
Chen_Lifu_DESC:0 "Chen Lifu spent most of his early life as a typical intellectual with a promising future in fields of engineering, having no interest in politics. However, his brother Chen Guofu fully devoted himself in the business of politics, and eventually used his close ties with Chiang to gain the position of Confidential Secretary for Chen Lifu, pushing Chen Lifu into the inner circle at a relatively young age.\n\nChen Guofu and Chen Lifu were considered the masters of the Central Club, known by others as the CC Clique, and while Chen Guofu had the most amount of political capital and led the CC Clique into prominent status, his worsening illness and eventual death in 1951 elevated Chen Lifu's status. While Chen Lifu has retained his lack of interest in over-the-top politicking, he has sworn to pick up the legacy of his older brother, and has fully committed himself to the role of a politician."
He_Yingqin_DESC:0 "A native of Guizhou, He Yingqin is the model revolutionary military leader that witnessed China's transformation through the eras. He became acquainted with his fellow student Chiang Kai-shek when studying in Japan, and studied most of his military skills from Imperial Japan.\n\nHolding a position in the officer rank since 1916, He Yingqin was appointed the General Instructor of Whampoa Military Academy, slowly climbing his way to a high position within the National Revolutionary Army. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, He Yingqin was appointed the Chief of Staff and worked closely with the Generalissimo on developing military strategies, reaching the peak of his career and granting him a great amount of power to become one of the leaders in the Huangpu Clique.\n\nAfter the war and the following resuming of the Civil War, He Yingqin maintained his high status within the government and the military, later on becoming the leader of China after years and years of anticipation."
Xiong_Shihui_DESC:0 "Xiong Shihui graduated from Baoding Military Academy in 1915 and later finished his military education in Japan by 1924.\n\nXiong Shihui was appointed by Chiang Kai-shek as the Chief of Jiangxi in 1931, and from that point onward he crawled his way into the core of the political system. During this time, Xiong Shihui has slowly became a prominent member of the Political Science Clique, serving in the Northeast after the Second Sino-Japanese War before being replaced by Chen Cheng's Dongbei Authority.\n\nWith Zhang Qun, Xiong Shihui has managed to expand the Political Science Clique, and later using his character and influence to become the leader, and eventually - the President of the Republic of China."
Zhang_Qun_DESC:0 "Zhang Qun studied in the Baoding Military Academy, but soon studied military in Japan. There, he became the schoolmate of Chiang Kai-shek, later on, taking part in many of the internal conflicts that occured in China.\n\nOther than military, Zhang Qun also took part in politics, becoming the Mayor of Shanghai by 1930, Chief of Hubei by 1932 and eventually, the Security Commander of Sichuan. After the Second Sino-Japanese War, Zhang Qun took part in various multinational diplomatic conferences under the orders of Chiang, at the same time, he slowly solidified the Political Science Clique's position within the Central Government, using his experience in politics to ensure the prosperity of his faction and himself, ultimately taking the position of Chiang Kai-shek's successor."

LU_HAN_DESC:0 "§YLu Han§!\n\n§gA military man, Lu Han served under Long Yun in the Yunnan Army. The two men had a strong bond with their history of overthrowing the Old Yunnan Clique together and other military actions during the Second Sino-Japanese War. However, during the renewed Chinese Civil War, Long Yun was heavily suspected due to his alleged communist ties. The Central Government placed significant pressure on Yunnan, forcing Long Yun to resign.\n\nSince Long Yun's \"willing resignation\", Lu Han has stepped in and replaced Yun as the Governor of Yunnan. Lu Han seeks to continue Long's policy of development and socio-economic stability in Yunnan, with occasional military cooperation with the Central Government.§!"
YUN_DESC:0 "§YYunnan Faction§!\n\n§gThe Yunnan Army, having existed since the Qing Dynasty, is a regional power that has extended its influence far beyond the confines of Yunnan Province. During the early 20th Century, Yunnan was famously influenced by the French presence in Indochina, developing a unique, modern military style as a result. With qualities such as high quality equipment, courageous troops and a history of fearless devotion to the Republic, Yunnan soldiers have gained good reputations in the minds of fellow Chinese soldiers and their enemies.§!"
GXC_DESC:0 "§YGuangxi Faction§!\n\n§gHistorically disadvantaged due to its location, the rough terrain of the region shaped Guangxi's troops into unbelievably tough fighters. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Guangxi soldiers demonstrated their willingness to sacrifice themselves for victory in battle. Thanks to Guangxi's great involvement during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the province's conditions have been improved, which has resulted in an increased quality of equipment for the local military.§!"
MAN_DESC:0 "§YDongbei Faction§!\n\n§gThe current Dongbei Faction has no relation to the old Fengtian Clique. The Dongbei Faction (Tu Mu), formerly known as the 11th Corp-18th Army is an elite military formation under Chen Cheng. This formation was regarded the best equipped in all of China (thanks to Chen Cheng's status), serving as elite formation during the Second Sino-Japanese War. These advantages have continued to this day, using confiscated Manchukuo and Japanese military equipment, Dongbei is one of the first regions in China that have experimented with military mechanization.§!"
SHX_DESC:0 "§YShanxi Faction§!\n\n§gThroughout history, Shanxi has been surrounded bu hostiles. But despite the chaos surrounding the region, Shanxi has maintained its composure, steadily developing with its rich natural resources. Shanxi is best known for one of China's best small arms production sites, managing to supply its forces with adequate consistent supplies.§!"
XIBEI_DESX:0 "§YXibei Faction§!\n\n§gFeared by its foes, the Xibei Ma Army is famous for its great calvary formations. These horse warriors from Northwest China struck fear in both the Chinese Communists and the invading Japanese, with these troops being a significant factor in the Communists' defeat in the North. However, these forces are exceptionally brutal in combat, a trait commonly seen among the ranks due to their nomadic roots.§!"
LI_ZONGREN_WARLORD_DESC:0 "§YLi Zongren§!\n\n§gLi Zongren is an esteemed figure. From his acts of overthrowing the Old Guangxi Clique to serving under the Republic, Li Zongren found the most glory during his service in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Li's masterful leadership secured China some much needed victories during a time of dire national morale, elevating his status beyond that of a Guangxi Hero, into a National Hero.\n\nWith this newfound respect and resources after the war, Li Zongren is once again handling Guangxi. However, his quarrels with the Central Government developed in the Central Plains War has lingered on, leading to a gradual increase in involvement on the Central Government's politics. Perhaps Li Zongren's goals have expanded beyond the small, barren region of Guangxi, and has now take shape as a vision for China as a whole.§!"
CHEN_CHENG_WARLORD_DESC:0 "§YChen Cheng§!\n\n§gChen Cheng is a skillful figure, both as a military man and a trusted bureaucrat. With close ties to Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng gained a favourable position as "Head of the Dongbei Authority" after the end of the Chinese Civil War, transforming his elite military formation into a new, strong regional power in Chinese politics.\n\nDespite his appointment in Dongbei, Chen never gave up on his ambitions in the Central Government, maintaining his allies and connections in Nanjing, while simultaneously developing his regional might to repeatedly increase his influence on national politics. As Chiang's protégé, Chen's plans might be far grander than maintaining his influence as the leader of Dongbei - plans that might seek to alter China drastically if conditions would present such an opportunity.§!"
YAN_XISHAN_DESC:0 "§YYan Xishan§!\n\n§gUnlike other warlords of his time, Yan Xishan is not a man that could be pleased with power and wealth. What Yan Xishan truly desires are things that could improve the livelihood of his countrymen, such as infrastructure, improved farms and quality education.\n\nYan Xishan does not have a specific ideology, though his plans often revolve around ideas of stability and prosperity, and he is willing to enact progressive reforms for the betterment of his people. However, this means Yan Xishan is not particularly fonded of anything or any other form of broader political scheming, with his focus being his province and the people which he serves.§!"
MA_HONGKUI_DESC:0 "§YMa Hongkui§!\n\n§gSon of the famous general Ma Fuxiang, Ma Hongkui is a leading figure in the Ma Faction, with his position as Governor of Ningxia granting him great privileges. Often, Ma Hongkui is referred by many as "the King of Ningxia", with his almost monarchical power and lavish lifestyle silently tolerated by the Central Government - perhaps a favour given by the Central Government thanks to Ma Hongkui's harsh stance on slaughtering Chinese Communists.\n\nAlong with Ma Bufang and Ma Hongbin, Ma Hongkui is a core member of the Ma Clique.§!"
MA_HONGBIN_DESC:0 "§YMa Hongbin§!\n\n§gSon of Ma Fulu and a cousin of Ma Hongkui, Ma Hongbin is a successful general, managing to defeat both Japanese and Communist forces while leading the 81th Army. Like other prominent members of the Ma Faction, Ma Hongbin also enjoys great influence and power over his governate in Gansu.\n\nAlong with Ma Hongkui and Ma Bufang, Ma Hongbin is a core member of the Ma Clique.§!"
MA_BUFANG_DESC:0 "§YMa Bufang§!\n\n§gSon of the famous Ma Qi, Ma Bufang's rise to power was an impressive feat, with cooperation and pacts formed with other neighbouring factions, effectively creating the modern Ma Clique. Ma Bufang is a capable general and a regional leader. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he demonstrated his loyalty to the Republic and his willingness to defend the nation with his multi-cultural army. In many forms, Ma Bufang is the dominant figure compared to his neighbouring Mas, backed up by his powerful figure and strong character.\n\nBeing a core member of the Ma Clique, alongside Ma Hongkui and Ma Hongbin, Ma Bufang is also involved with national politics, with close relations to the Huangpu Clique.§!"
MA_HUSHAN_DESC:0 "§YMa Hushan§!\n\n§gUnlike the other Mas, Ma Hushan's influence in Xinjiang is relatively new. Once a follower of Ma Zhongying, Ma Hushan has a long history of activity in Xinjiang, with him briefly ruling as the leader of "Tunganistan", a fundamentalist, mismanaged state in the southern parts of Xinjiang. However, not long after the establishment of Tunganistan, Ma Hushan soon found himself abandoned by his people, which resulted in his eventual defeat by Xinjiang warlord Sheng Shicai.\n\nDisgraced, Ma Hushan became an irrelevant member of the Ma Clique, unable to redeem himself until the successful invasion of Xinjiang, which Ma Hushan was finally appointed as the Governor of Xinjiang, replacing the former Pro-Soviet Sheng, becoming a new, yet important part of the Ma Clique.§!"

The NRA is, in theory, a force capable of not only defending China from foreign aggressors but also a force which can be used to once again project Chinas influence across all of Asia.\n\nIn practice, however, the NRA is a ragtag force of militias and semi-professional forces, with large sections of the military being beyond the control of Chiang and the central government. The army is effectively split between the central government and several large local powers within China. These powers, the §OGuangxi Clique§!, the §RShanxi Clique§!, §HXibei Si Ma§!, the §GYunnan Clique§! and the §gDongbei Authority§! will be reluctant to commit their personal forces to any conflict, and convincing them to submit to the authority of the central government will be no easy task. \n\n§YThe National Revolutionary Army§! currently has §Y[?num_divisions]§! active Divisions."

CHI_Generalissimo_Chiang_desc:0 "Our great Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek rules China, but his rule is not total. Various warlords and KMT figures also hold considerable sway in government, and are limits and risks to Chiang's power. These must be dealt with somehow, by strengthening Chiang's position within China."
CHI_House_Of_Cards:0 "House of Cards"
CHI_House_Of_Cards_desc:0 "While internationally, Chiang gives the impression of a powerful, unified Nationalist Party ruling China with unity and efficiency and with himself at the top, the truth is far from that. The KMT itself is a mess of conflicting figures and interests, not to mention warlords still holding considerable power over their provinces. Chiang may be at the top, but he struggles to hold together these competing interests."
CHI_Anti_Communists:0 "Target the Communists"
CHI_Anti_Communists_desc:0 "As always, communists remain a threat and bother to China. While we mostly stamped them out during the 1940s, as always, a few manage to escape, survive and multiply again. If Chiang, the KMT and China as a whole are to truly come together and advance, the communist threat must be more thoroughly stamped out."
CHI_Handle_The_Cliques:0 "Handling the Cliques"
CHI_Handle_The_Cliques_desc:0 "To this day, various warlord groups and Cliques hold significant autonomy and power within the overall government of China. For China's stability and progress, these groups must be 'dealt with', either brought into line and onto our side or weakened."
CHI_Create_A_Scapegoat:0 "Creating a Scapegoat"
CHI_Create_A_Scapegoat_desc:0 "The communist Vietnamese have been harbouring some communist exiles from our country. While this is irritating, it is mostly harmless, as Vietnam has no hope of destroying us. That said, we can use this to our advantage - with the Vietnamese acting in such a way as to aid traitors to our nation, we can use this as an excuse to create a new scapegoat to concentrate the nation's energy on - Vietnam itself."
CHI_The_Southern_Border:0 "The Southern Border"
CHI_The_Southern_Border_desc:0 "When we smashed the communists within China, those that survived fled to neighbouring countries. Many crossed the border into communist-controlled Vietnam, welcomed by Ho Chi Minh as allies. As a result, we must regard Vietnam as an enemy nation that has aided traitors of our country, and act accordingly with regards to our southern border."
CHI_War_Of_Liberation:0 "A War of Liberation"
CHI_War_Of_Liberation_desc:0 "Our nationalist Vietnamese allies are ready to rise up in the North near our border, and local forces are prepared to attack. We have only to give the signal for them to begin their uprising, and then we can send our own forces in to help them and to liberate the nation of Vietnam from its communist rulers."
CHI_The_Grand_Victory:0 "The Grand Victory"
CHI_The_Grand_Victory_desc:0 "Though the war was perhaps harder than we initially expected, our forces in the end have prevailed over the Vietnamese communists. Ho Chi Minh has been toppled, and our allies have been installed in Vietnam. This is a great victory, not just for China, but also for Chiang, the architect of this war. From here, his rule can only be further strengthened."
CHI_The_Vietnamese_Shame:0 "The Vietnamese Shame"
CHI_The_Vietnamese_Shame_desc:0 "Disaster has struck us in Vietnam. The tenacious defence of Vietnamese regular and guerrilla forces have thwarted our attacks. With our troops taking unacceptable losses with little progress, and their already low morale dropping to dangerous levels, we have had no choice but to accept defeat and withdraw. This has undoubtedly harmed Chiang's position. We'll see where this goes."
CHI_Consolidation_of_Power:0 "Consolidate Power"
CHI_Consolidation_of_Power_desc:0 "The recent victory over Vietnam has done much for Chiang's prestige as leader of China. Though there were those who doubted that this war could be won, their doubts have been silenced. Chiang can now further consolidate his rule over the party, the government, and the country, and can at last carry out his planned agenda."
CHI_Victory_in_the_Struggles:0 "Victory in the Struggles"
CHI_Victory_in_the_Struggles_desc:0 "Traitors within the KMT attempted to remove Chiang. Fortunately, their backstabbing attacks have failed. While Chiang's position has been severely weakened by the humiliating defeat against Vietnam, the Generalissimo has nonetheless managed to cling to power. It will be up to him to rebuild his power base."
CHI_Control_the_Kuomintang:0 "Control the Kuomintang"
CHI_Control_the_Kuomintang_desc:0 "The Kuomintang, China's ruling Nationalist Party, has long been weak or fragmented. In the wake of the war, the party must be drawn back together and under Chiang's command. There can be no more weakness from within - the party must fall into line."
CHI_Crush_The_Communist_Elements:0 "Crush the Communist Elements"
CHI_Crush_The_Communist_Elements_desc:0 "With the Vietnam war distracting our armed forces, hidden communist elements had again begun to rise from the ashes. This is simply an unacceptable threat to the country. We must again sweep the nation to stamp out the communist menace once and for all."
CHI_New_White_Terror:0 "New White Terror"
CHI_New_White_Terror_desc:0 "Violence and brutality is the only way to crush the communists. Every time they have been beaten in the past, they have escaped and risen again. This time, we must hunt them down and destroy them with such terror that they are smashed once and for all and will never rise again. A new 'white terror' will be unleashed across the country."
CHI_The_Chinese_Agenda:0 "The Chinese Agenda"
CHI_The_Chinese_Agenda_desc:0 "China, as a nation, must rise back to its rightful place on the world stage. The effects of the century of humiliation must at last be undone. China must follow a foreign policy agenda that pushes for its rightful hegemony over Asia to be restored, and Chiang Kai-shek is the man who will push this agenda forwards."
CHI_Anti_Imperialistic_Diplomacy:0 "Anti-Imperialistic Diplomacy"
CHI_Anti_Imperialistic_Diplomacy_desc:0 "Ever since the beginning of the 'century of humiliation', western imperialists have dominated Asian affairs. Even as the power of the Europeans wanes as a result of the German hegemony, the Americans rise to fill their place, extending their influence across the pacific and supporting puppets in Korea, eastern Russia and South East Asia. This must now be brought to an end. Asia must liberate itself, with China as its protector."
CHI_The_Great_Republic:0 "The Great Republic"
CHI_The_Great_Republic_desc:0 "With Chiang's policies, China is restoring its place, with the prestige of old, but led as a republic rather than an empire. China can now truly call itself a great republic, a modern nation of hundreds of millions and vast territories, the size of an empire but with institutions to fit the modern age."
CHI_Cult_Of_Personality:0 "Cult of Personality"
CHI_Cult_Of_Personality_desc:0 "The success and greatness of China is, more than anything, due to the strong and capable leadership of the Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. It was him that guided China through difficult times, and the people must come to know and appreciate that. The image and words of Chiang will be printed and spoken across the nation, so all will recognise their great leader."
CHI_Weaken_Key_Opponents:0 "Weaken Key Opponents"
CHI_Weaken_Key_Opponents_desc:0 "Within the KMT, there are those that have secretly or overtly opposed many of Chiang's actions. While we do not possess the strength to destroy them outright like with the communists and other traitors, through political maneuvering their strength can be curbed and their influence weakened."
CHI_Expand_The_Central_Army:0 "Expand the Central Army"
CHI_Expand_The_Central_Army_desc:0 "Large parts of China's army still remain de facto under the control of the warlords. This is, obviously, a threat to the central government's power. We must expand the central army that is under Chiang's direct control, to make sure that a warlord takeover or rebellion is not a real threat in the future."
CHI_Discredit_Local_Cliques:0 "Discredit the Local Cliques"
CHI_Discredit_Local_Cliques_desc:0 "Just as we strengthen central control, we must also weaken the provincial cliques across the country. Local cliques exercising extreme autonomy has caused much of the weakness of China in decades past, and this must come to an end. Local groups must be discredited and all the provinces of China must be brought into line under the Central Government and Chiang."
CHI_A_Fistful_Of_Democracy:0 "A Fistful of Democracy"
CHI_A_Fistful_Of_Democracy_desc:0 "Of course, China is not yet ready for full democracy as dictated under the three principles of Sun Yat-sen. However, the people and some reformists demand some representation, and so we will give them what they want. Limited elements of democracy will be introduced, while it will be kept weak enough for us to maintain ultimate power above the democratic process."
CHI_The_One_Family:0 "The One Family"
CHI_The_One_Family_desc:0 "In the past, China has been dominated by strong and significant families. The old four big families of China consisted of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen. Now, as Chiang expands his control, the Chiang family will be brought to the forefront, above the other three. There will be one family above all."
CHI_Steal_Chengs_Work:0 "Steal Chen Cheng's Work"
CHI_Steal_Chengs_Work_desc:0 "Chen Cheng, the intellectual that he is, had designed various proposals for reforms to China's political system. While we cannot risk him gaining too much power, it would not be too hard to quietly copy his ideas and rebrand them as our own. Chiang's new reforms can take 'inspiration' from those of others."
CHI_Attention_to_the_Economy:0 "Attention to the Economy"
CHI_Attention_to_the_Economy_desc:0 "In recent times, China's economy has not been the most stable or most developed in the world. However, every great power needs a strong economy. With domestic threats having been in large part dealt with, economic policy can come to the forefront. We will make sure that the potential of China's economic resources are utilised and a powerful economy rises. "
CHI_Eternal_President:0 "Eternal President"
CHI_Eternal_President_desc:0 "Chiang Kai-shek's power has been significantly increased, and threats to his rule mostly removed. Now, he is the eternal president of China, being able to rule for life. Long live the eternal president!"
CHI_Extend_The_Martial_Law:0 "Extend the Martial Law"
CHI_Extend_The_Martial_Law_desc:0 "China has been in essentially a state of effective martial law since the restarted Chinese civil war. While elements of military control have been removed, some remain, and some have called for the total abandonment of martial law. However, for Chiang's rule to be assured, and for stability to be maintained, for now the involvement of the military in civilian society must remain in place."
CHI_The_Nanjing_Years:0 "The Nanjing Years"
CHI_The_Nanjing_Years_desc:0 "From 1927 to 1937, the 'Nanjing decade' saw unparalleled stability and economic growth within China for the time, until the calamity of the war against Japan and the rise of the communists caused a significant setback. Now, with China not only stabilised but strengthened, and economic growth again increasing rapidly, the are new Nanjing years ahead of us."
CHI_Dynastic_Politics:0 "Dynastic Politics"
CHI_Dynastic_Politics_desc:0 "Chiang has asserted his family as the most powerful in China, yet now he must go a step further. A new political dynasty will be created, to pass on power to trusted family members and maintain stability for the future. Chiang Kai-shek's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, will be trained for a future position of great power."
CHI_Growth_Above_Principles:0 "Growth Above Principles"
CHI_Growth_Above_Principles_desc:0 "With stability restored, the days of political principles are, really, over. The political process of restoring China to its rightful place have mostly run their course - now the time has come to expand China by non-political means. Economic growth will be sought after first and foremost and above any political considerations, to bring strength to the Chinese nation and prosperity to its people."
CHI_Committee_In_Disarray:0 "Executive Committee in Disarray"
CHI_Committee_In_Disarray_desc:0 "\"The Tiger of Asia bestet by Vietnamese communists\" stated the headlines that rang in their heads. The glorious Republic of China Army after fighting for decades for the glory and unity of China at the supposed height of its power bestet by a country a couple hundred its size. The shame would probably be a black stain on both the Republic and its army for decades to come and none took more of the flak than the Generalissimo himself, Chiang Kai Shek. Suddenly the future of the Republic was shrouded in fog and already the powers behind the throne were making their moves..."
CHI_Longest_Days:0 "Longest Days"
CHI_Longest_Days_desc:0 "As the days grow shadowed so do we, the executive committee being in complete disarray and the cliques vying for power once more, the battles and rivalries that had long smoldered under the surface have come to the fore. With the Generalissimo no more an invincible hero it seems it is only a matter of time till someone else will take the reigns..."
CHI_Cracking_the_Tu_Mu:0 "Cracking the Tu Mu"
CHI_Cracking_the_Tu_Mu_desc:0 "Besides Dai's shadowy organization, another and far more dangerous dagger still lies within the Generalissimo's reach: Chen Cheng and his Tu Mu clique. With their military power and widespread respect they command within the KMT and populace we must act quickly to disarm Chen and his goons lest they snuff out this once in a lifetime opportunity that now presents itself..."
CHI_KMT_Factionalism:0 "Kuomintang Factionalism"
CHI_KMT_Factionalism_desc:0 "Despite always assuring the contrary, the Kuomintang has been as riddled with rifts and ravines, divides and factionalism as China was when it was born. Each and every faction having widely different hopes and ideas as to how the path, if at all, should lead to the final implementation of Dr. Sun's three principles. With the Generalissimo stumbling and soon perhaps falling, long and deep cracks have appeared upon the visage of the white sun and soon it may break completely..."
CHI_Nanjing_Insanity:0 "The Nanjing Insanity"
CHI_Nanjing_Insanity_desc:0 "And on and on a silent round of poker went along in the streets of Nanjing, with every round each player betting something whether they wanted or not. Cliques convened, favors were pulled, assassinations planned until none of the puppet masters even knew anymore whether they were King or pawn. And on and on the rounds went knives were drawn, oaths sworn, loyalties affirmed, betrayed, new pieces appeared and vanished again. \n\nUntil all of the players had no more pawns and only queens to wager and suddenly, as if the passage of time that had been suspended for the last day (or weeks?), started running again once more, and in one fell swoop..."

CHI_Political_Science_Faction:0 "Political Science Victory"
CHI_Political_Science_Faction_desc:0 "The long struggle is over. As the dust settles over Nanjing, the first truly civilian government in half a century has seized control of China, and the bureaucrats that hold sway over the nation's institutions have extended that influence into the dizzying heights of power in China itself. As dissidents loyal to the old regime are chased out of power, the Bureaucrats must make a choice.\n\nTwo factions within the Political Science Clique are in disagreement over the direction China must take to secure itself against its enemies. Xiong Shihui, ever-amicable with the military, views an alliance with the generals as a necessity to destroy the Clique's opposition. Zhang Qun, the negotiator, prefers the use of greased palms to smoothen and subvert opposition in the Republic. The Clique faces a choice - and China hangs in the balance."
CHI_President_Zhang:0 "President Zhang"
CHI_President_Zhang_desc:0 "The King of the Backroom Deals, Zhang Qun, has taken power in Nanjing. Our rival wings of the KMT have been relatively quick in acknowledging his victory, thanks to record-breaking new deals allowing the Huangpu and Tu Mu Cliques relative autonomy in provincial governance, and Xikang and Sichuan have been quick to propose regional 'special statuses' for their contributions to the National Treasury.\n\nZhang's belief in the power of a smiling face (and reasonable financial incentives to back it up) will reshape Chinese governance, emphasizing unity even further than the old Kuomintang ever dared. Increased diplomatic efforts abroad, a return to informal governance structures and the opening of massive discretionary funds will ensure China's stability - even if this stability is as entrenched in rot as the old order that preceded it."
CHI_President_Xiong:0 "President Xiong"
CHI_President_Xiong_desc:0 "President Xiong Shihui, the Friend of the Soldiers, has taken power in Nanjing. Already the military is scrambling to swear loyalty to the Government, and Jiangxi Province has been the first to officially recognize Xiong as head of state (no doubt related to his ties in the local administration). Xiong's belief in the power of the old order to reshape the new has lasting implications for all of the nation, as he begins to draw up plans for the merger of bureaucratic and military interests in China - with permanent effects on both.\n\nAs Xiong's personal interest group begins to outweigh all other domestic interests in policymaking influence, it is clear that the nation will come to resemble the tangled web of money, military force and bureaucratic control that is the President's inner circle. It might be a new day in Nanjing, but the dawn looks depressingly similar to that of the previous day's."
CHI_Politicking_On_Paper:0 "Politicking On Paper"
CHI_Politicking_On_Paper_desc:0 "Some might say we do not know how to run the nation, either in politics or in technical matters - but these people would be wrong. The Political Science Clique is in fact very well-versed in organising the subtle networks of power, influence and governance norms that comprise Chinese politics. Our manipulations simply take place on a realm far removed from the mundanity of political life. In truth, we are not building castles in the air; we are spinning wheels within wheels.\n\nAs the wheels spin, so too do the departments: regular shakeups of our highest ministries will assure the public that Something Is Being Done, and why would you ever question that, citizen? The country's leaders will write and rewrite their political theories, and although the paperwork will pile up and actual policymaking will struggle, China will walk closer to political perfection, true democracy, and enlightened governance."
CHI_Separate_the_Party_Government:0 "Separate the Party and Government"
CHI_Separate_the_Party_Government_desc:0 "For many years our Republic was known as a Dang-Guo, a Party-State: the Kuomintang filled the aisles of power and controlled key aspects of the Government, blurring the lines between the two entities. For the sake of the country - and our political footing - this must end. An added clause to the Constitution formalizing boundaries between political parties and the government agencies they participate in will ensure that the corruption of party politics is kept far away from the core of the Republic.\n\nWe will, however, introduce Special Clauses into the Constitution to ensure that some parts of the Party are kept, ah, at a warm distance to the levers of power - for instance, bureaucrats with positions of power in the Kuomintang will be taken as neutral entities, capable of carrying out their duties to both the Constitution and the White Sun. Only subversive elements and those who have defiled China will be affected: for loyal servants, nothing will have to change."
CHI_The_Bureaucratic_Machine:0 "The Bureaucratic Machine"
CHI_The_Bureaucratic_Machine_desc:0 "When we were consolidating power in the Kuomintang we were divided, even fragmented, by petty factional loyalties and political disagreements. No more! From now on, the Political Science Clique will move and strike as a united force in the halls of power. We will reorganize those departments in the Government, the Executive and Control Yuan in particular, to ensure bureaucratic dominance holds sway over every executive decision.\n\nWe must also take care to secure our flanks against opposition: changes to the operation of the National Assembly will strip rival factions of substantial privileges in the name of progress. Just to ensure that the independence of the executive branch is upheld, rival parties will also be, ah, monitored for subversive activities."
CHI_Inflate_the_Government:0 "Inflating the Government"
CHI_Inflate_the_Government_desc:0 "Good governance is when the Republic issues directives - the more directives it issues, the better it is. This surely infallible principle of government has inspired our executive branch to issue an ambitious set of reforms that will bring our key stakeholders into the regime - the informal obligations we will bind these stakeholders with will make them more than compliant to our rule, and financially incentivised to enforce our command in the social sphere.\n\nWe have also expanded the scope of our government, for industry leaders have far bigger roles to play in governance than in industry alone - their social circles, their connections to our political rivals - and their price for colluding with us in the destruction of our opposition.

If a member of the Principled Opposition were to die in a regrettable accident, and if that folder were to be found in his possession by Western intelligence agents - we would be entirely correct in treating this matter as a subversive operation, and in allowing Western agents unlimited sanction in pacifying our obviously rogue political elements, would we not?"

We will begin to usurp the power of Chiang Kai Shek for our own, pulling him out in public to give speeches in support of our regime.\n\nIn a magnanimous act of reconciliation, we will even unveil official Chiang memorabilia in the Presidential Palace and in key government installations, honoring his legacy besides that of the Founder, Dr. Sun. A little greased palms (and perhaps a threat to his surviving family, to spice the message up a little) will leaven his former enmity towards us, and if we can incorporate the loyalists of his devoted fan base, well, the sky's the limit.

We will ensure that the army, like the state, will be both strong and rich, as military commanders will receive better and higher integration into state institutions as their assistance to the President increases.

Naval bombardment could take place at further distances than ever thought possible, making our ships invulnerable to conventional anti-ship measures.\n\nOf course, this is really far easier said than done. The development of these nascent missile systems is projected to take 20 years even in far better research environments than ours.

Innovative designs suggest that a type of rotor like the propellers that support our planes could, if set over the chassis, provide rapid lift and descent capabilities. More importantly, these designs could hover above battlefronts, providing covering fire and visual targeting to ground units, and lifting units to safety upon the termination of combat.\n\nThis could, to put it bluntly, revolutionize warfare - and China cannot afford to be late to this Revolution.

What is needed is a means to engage the enemy long before he is in sight, so that our air superiority can be enforced without threat.\n\nThe AIM-series missile prototypes developed in American facilities have therefore proven of significant interest to us.

Complex securities, borrowed from the American system, are in the works - these are explicitly tied to the value of inflation, further increasing consumer confidence in their yields. With these soft instruments, we will prod the Chinese fiscal juggernaut into roaring, vital life."

CHI_A_Stable_Currency_desc:0 "The blueprints have been drawn, the guidelines set, the financial institutions nurtured to health - it is time we declared victory over inflation. With an official transition to secondary priorities like industrial development and expansion of infrastructure, we will take our place amongst the fellow developing nations of the world as a stable, beckoning source of consumer confidence. The new plan is to boost domestic industrial growth in a manner championed by our domestic economists. They call it import-substitution, and it might just be the future. \n\nThey say high tariffs and a ramp-up of domestic industry will secure our currency from within. They say the Chinese market could, for the first time in a century, be the tiger that rides the world rather than bowing before it. They say the markets of Shanghai and Wuchang will soon become nexuses of international trade and investment, and that when China gives orders - the world will be led by its wallets. \n\nAnd, as the Vermillion Dragon begins to flex in his slumber, it is looking like they may be right."

And, studies suggest, the freewheeling state of affairs governing China's economy could in fact be made to benefit consumer confidence. Only minute tweaks to the fiscal system are required, not huge, destabilizing changes. If we thought otherwise, we'd have kept faith with the Communists, wouldn't we? \n\nThe Banks of China will be key to this: through their adept usage of commodities, stocks and other monetary alternatives, they have almost single-handedly kept China's financial sector afloat. We shall encourage the banks to continue doing so, even as we look into something our economists call \"provincial financing\" to replicate the same effect on the local level with small loans. And the Government shall not have to waste a single Dollar!"

CHI_Embracing_Inflation_desc:0 "Really, if we think about it, inflation isn't so bad, isn't it? If money is just an arbitrary estimation of value, then an increase or decrease in this number doesn't mean anything. China might have invented paper currency, but its assets have always lain in better things than money - like the strength of our textile and agrarian markets. With all this in mind, perhaps the latest numbers from our Economists shouldn't worry us too much. \n\nIn fact, when we analyse the details, what we see here is the trimming of excess, not the loss of potential! Collapsing consumer confidence, mass unemployment exploding thanks to uncertainty over payroll numbers, the failure of our loan schemes due to aforementioned collapse in confidence - only a little falling-in of the unsustainable heights of our economic fortress, to protect the greater, stronger whole. \n\nYes, it's really nothing to worry about. And as for the foreign firms looking to invest - well, our stocks have quite literally never been higher, have they?"

So it has been and so it shall ever be, given that international investment is increasingly dominant in what is left of our economy. That said, there are methods to, ah, maximize the opportunity this vulnerability brings us. \n\nA floated exchange rate, one whose value relative to foreign currencies is dictated by market demand and supply, could bring us stability and much longed-for consumer confidence, and stabilize the value of our currency alternatives. More importantly, it would open the market to foreign investments and allow us to focus on domestic interest rates on currency - all of which would buffer the shockwaves rippling through the small markets of China. \n\nIt is unpopular, to say the least, even exploitative. But in the long run this will only benefit us. Eventually."

twrchina.1975451.d:0 "When China was suffering from political instability due to Li Zongren's failed attempt at a great purge, the formerly 'forcibly-retired' Chiang Kai-Shek was assassinated. It is claimed that a lone gunman managed to sneak into the Ex-Generalissimo's room, where he fired 4 shots into Chiang Kai-Shek's body. Within seconds, the gunman was apprehended by Chiang's bodyguards. Chiang Kai-Shek was rushed to the nearest medical facility, but after 21 hours of frantic emergency treatment, the Former Generalissimo was declared dead by the medical staff.\n\nThe gunman, a Taiwanese Separatist named Lin Chao-hui, was sentenced to death 55 times and 440 life sentences without parole. All public activities are suspended for a period of 5 weeks. China has officially entered a state of mourning."
twrchina.1975451.a:0 "Oh no...Generalissimo!"

twrchina.0.d:0 "On the 10th of October, 1911, our forefathers in Wuchang lit the fuse for a nationwide revolution to overthrow the corrupt Qing Dynasty. While the Republic might have suffered from multiple crises and encountered hardships, the Chinese people have proven themselves to be resilient.\n\nFrom expelling the Manchu barbarians from the Middle Kingdom, living through the Age of Strife under multiple incompetent leaders and warlords, standing up to the Japanese when rest of the world watched silently, the Republic of China prevailed! 10/10 is a date that all Chinese people must remember, and with it, let us rejoice!\n\nAs our dear father detailed in his doctrine, the three words that must be engraved into the hearts of liberated souls all around China - Mínzú! Mínquán! Mínshēng!"
twrchina.0.a:0 "Long Live the Republic!"

twrchina.1.t:0 "The Communist Party Returns from Exile"
twrchina.1.d:0 "After the official lifting of the Communist ban by Li Zongren, many Chinese Communist Party members have returned from exile in Vietnam, Mongolia and elsewhere. Most notably, the leader of the Vietnamese Office - Liu Shaoqi. However, the Mongolian Office - Li Xiannian chose to remain in exile rather than accept the offer. Considering the fact that Liu Shaoqi is the official figurehead taking part in the historic talks with Li Zongren, he has been allowed to form an official political party in China (The Chinese Communist Party), albeit smaller and less powerful than their greatest extend many years ago. There is some speculation that they will grow to the size they once were, but it is suggested that the new Communist Party is merely a fake opposition propped up by the Central Government, with factions such as the Mongol Faction openly protesting against Liu's actions from abroad."
twrchina.1.a:0 "Look who's back..."

twrchina.2.t:0 "The Communists Gain Traction"
twrchina.2.d:0 "It seems that the CPC hasn't lost all its popularity yet. Recently, it has held a rally in Chongqing, with Zhou Enlai making a grand speech in front of thousands of peasants and workers. The party is seemingly regaining their old popularity once again, mostly due to agitations against our current government. Many anti-communists in our government have complained that this will lead to a possible communist takeover, and urged that we shut them down immediately."
twrchina.2.a:0 "Let them hold more silly rallies."
twrchina.2.b:0 "We must shut them down at once!"

twrchina.3.t:0 "Tibet Sends a Delegation"
twrchina.3.d:0 "Perhaps out of fear, perhaps out of genuine friendship, Tibet has sent a delegation to Nanjing to talk about the possible integration of Tibet into the Republic of China as an autonomous region in which the Dalai Lama would retain local ceremonial powers. We have welcomed them with open arms, and we will be gaining Tibet back."
twrchina.3.a:0 "We send our thanks to the Dalai Lama."

twrchina.301.t:0 "Tibet Talks Successful"
twrchina.301.d:0 "Our talks with Tibet have met with enormous success. Tibetan leaders, including the Dalai Lama, have agreed that Tibet will come under the protection of the Republic of China as an autonomous state. We will gain control over their foreign affairs, while guaranteeing the autonomy of their internal affairs and the continuing place of the Dalai Lama as a national figurehead."
twrchina.301.a:0 "Excellent."

twrchina.4.t:0 "The Republic of China"
twrchina.4.d:0 "For some time now, the Republic of China has stood as Asia's rising potential hegemon ever since Japan fell, outside the looming outside power of the United States.\n\nEstablished in 1912 with the fall of the Qing Empire after the Xinhai Revolution, the old Republic quickly devolved into warlords fighting amongst each other.\n\nIt was the Kuomintang who would seize the initiative, and in the mid-to-late 20s came the Northern Expedition, where Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek led his men from Guangdong to Beijing, successfully unifying China.\n\nRebellions against him in the Central Plains War were quickly put down but in 1937 came the greatest threat, as Japan attacked with a brutal invasion. Chiang Kai-Shek was forced to create a United Front with the Communists, with which they fought the Japanese invaders and won.\n\nThe Chinese Civil War, put on hold by the wartime truce between the Nationalists and Communists, soon broke out yet again after the defeat of Japan, leading to a victory by the Kuomintang. China was finally, truly whole again, and this is where we start our story."

twrchina.6.t:0 "Sun Li-Jen Speaks Out"
twrchina.6.d:0 "General Sun Li-Jen, a famous Nationalist commander that has served us well during the Chinese Civil War and the Second Sino-Japanese War, has spoken out against our government and its allegedly 'oppressive' economic and social policies. He has denouced President Chiang's vision of a brand new Nationalist China. We cannot shut him down as of his standing amongst the people, but we will need to make moves against him."
twrchina.6.a:0 "He has been nothing but trouble..."

twrchina.7.t:0 "Warehouse Raid in Shanghai"
twrchina.7.d:0 "Shanghai has had one of its many warehouses raided by our police force for allegedly holding opium and many other drugs and illegal substances and materials. We have found those allegations to be true, and that the Triads are linked to this warehouse. Our men are currently scouring the area for clues."
twrchina.7.a:0 "Damn criminals..."

twrchina.8.t:0 "Unrest in Taiwan"
twrchina.8.d:0 "After the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Republic of China liberated Taiwan from Japanese rule. At first, the locals rejoiced and welcomed the Republican government but living standards have allegedly declined since the arrival of the Taiwan Provincial Chief Executive's Office. A series of riots and uprisings occured during the early stage of reintegration, with a major incident occuring in 1950, as an accidental killing sparked over 20 days of riots and civil conflict between groups of local militia and the Taiwanese Garrison.\n\nToday, in Taipei and Kaohsiung, thousands of Taiwanese locals gathered to mourn the death of these rebels and protest against Sinicization that seeks the destruction of their culture, targeting Internal immigrants businesses and the local authorities while chanting for greater autonomy or complete independence from the corrupted Nanjing Government. Leftist elements are suspected to be part of the driving force behind this protest, but the Taiwanese Government claim to have this situation under control."
twrchina.8.a:0 "Shoot them."

twrchina.9.t:0 "Arrest of University Students"
twrchina.9.d:0 "Reports have come in that a University in Changsha is spreading Communist propaganda and lies to woo the students there to Communism. The local armed police have been sent to the University to root out any potential troublemakers and Communist revolutionaries. This is for the protection of the country, and we must not allow our youth to be influenced by vile Communism. We are currently deciding what to do with them - to either kill the Communist sympathizers, or to spare them and instead send them to prison."
twrchina.9.a:0 "Communism has no place here! Execute them!"

twrchina.10.a:0 "A toast to our friends in Germany!"

twrchina.11.t:0 "Taiwanese Protests End"
twrchina.11.d:0 "The protests in Taiwan have ended, with the riot police pushing back the natives. No protestors or police were killed, although many were injured, including in particular a man beaten so hard his face has been left deformed and bloody after attempting to attack an officer with a large sword. Many officers were wounded, too, and those that were have been given distinctions."
twrchina.11.a:0 "Good job!"

twrchina.12.t:0 "Protests in Nanjing"
twrchina.12.d:0 "Nanjing has been experiencing quite the wave of protests recently, with many taking to the streets again, this time in front of the Presidential Palace. We have let them protest, but the police will be sent in if it gets too violent."
twrchina.12.a:0 "When will these protests stop?"

twrchina.13.t:0 "The Trial of the Academics"
twrchina.13.d:0 "A group of 60 professors, teachers and university students was put on trial today for treasonous acts against the Republic, mostly consisting of writing anti-Kuomintang books and papers.. All were found guilty, and are to serve long and hefty sentences off the coast on remote prison islands. However, rumors have been circulating that the trials were rigged, and that the Republic was simply putting down freedom of speech. To that, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek responds, saying that the trials were all fair and unbiased."
twrchina.13.a:0 "Good riddance."

twrchina.14.t:0 "Liánhé Fruit Formed"
twrchina.14.d:0 "In the Republic of China, the concept 'conflict of interest' is rather vague.\n\nThe Invasion of Vietnam created a new range of issues regarding supplies, and the government sought a business partner in providing the army with rations. This profitable business opportunity was noticed by H. H. Kung. Despite his ties with the government, he managed to establish the Liánhé Fruit Produce Company with his immense wealth and government support, assuming the task of producing lunch meat for the military while researching prototype rations and produce products for the Chinese supply chain or even consumer market.\n\nThanks to the fact that the company being a strange hybrid  of government and private enterprise, it is expected to become a hegemon in the Chinese market with little to no opposition."
twrchina.14.a:0 "Come buy your lunch meat!"

twrchina.15.t:0 "Rid Vietnam of Communism!"
twrchina.15.d:0 "The time has finally come - our allies in northern Vietnam, ready to resist the scourge of communism with our support, are ready to rise up! It is finally within our grasp to rid the Asian continent of communism, and bring vengeance to those Chinese communists who have escaped into Vietnam.\n\nOur forces, while unprepared, can surely bring a crushing victory with overwhelming numbers. We now have only to send in the men and we shall be triumphant!"
twrchina.15.a:0 "For China!"

twrchina.151.t:0 "China Bombs our Roads"
twrchina.151.d:0 "Unable to win fairly, the Chinese have resorted to dirty tactics! They have begun bombing our main roads in an attempt to break our logistical networks and starve our forces of supplies. We must continue to resist!"
twrchina.151.a:0 "Never!"

twrchina.16.t:0 "The Armistice"
twrchina.16.d:0 "Though we have made some progress, we have failed to win the war outright, and now continuing it is an enormous drain on our country and army. The Vietnamese, too, are tired of war, and have come to negotiate. It has been agreed that an armistice will go into effect, splitting the nation of Vietnam between the south that will remain communist, and the north still under our occupation. Officially, the fate of Vietnam will be resolved by a future peace treaty, but many doubt this will ever come or be successful. For now, however, the war is over, and neither side has won."
twrchina.16.a:0 "We must accept."

twrchina.17.t:0 "Defeat in Vietnam"
twrchina.17.d:0 "The war has been a disaster. We have made little progress, and lost much. Our soldiers die in the thousands for no gain, killed by traps or guerrilla ambush in the jungles. The soldiers curse their leaders for sending them into this hell, while at home, even loyal KMT members are beginning to question the wisdom of the government in continuing this campaign.\n\nWe have no choice, we must withdraw our army in disgrace. The war must end."
twrchina.17.a:0 "Shameful."

twrchina.1701.t:0 "UN-enforced Retreat"
twrchina.1701.d:0 "As we did not veto the UN resolution for peace in Vietnam, we have been forced to halt our offensive, and accept a UN-mediated ceasefire, leading to eventual withdrawal of all our forces from the country.\n\nThis is a major defeat for our nation on the world stage."
twrchina.1701.a:0 "Shameful."

twrchina.171.t:0 "Triumph in Vietnam"
twrchina.171.d:0 "The road has been hard, but we have won and China is triumphant. Vietnam has fallen to our armies, and the communists have been crushed. Though resistance continues across much of the country, and the cost has been great, we can begin to build a new Vietnam under our protection."
twrchina.171.a:0 "Victory at last!"

twrchina.172.t:0 "China Attacks!"
twrchina.172.d:0 "Simultaneously to an uprising against our government in the north of the country, the Chinese have launched a full-scale invasion to the north. It is clear this was an orchestrated event, with the 'rebels' traitors implanted by Nanjing to prepare for their attack and to create an excuse for the invasion.\n\nHowever, we must not give up! Vietnam has resisted many enemies in recent decades, and we will resist this one as well. Our Republic of the People will stand firm!\n\n(Note - Resist China for one year, and the war will end with China's defeat)"
twrchina.172.a:0 "Fight to the death!"

twrchina.173.t:0 "Triumph Against China!"
twrchina.173.d:0 "The road has been hard, but we have won the Chinese have been driven from our nation in defeat! They have ravaged much of the north of the country, but now they are vanquished. We have won!"
twrchina.173.a:0 "Victory at last!"

twrchina.174.t:0 "The Armistice"
twrchina.174.d:0 "Though we have stopped the Chinese from fully conquering our country, the war is not going well at all. Our soldiers are exhausted, much of the country is occupied - many believe we cannot sustain this for much longer.\n\nFortunately, the Chinese are just as exhausted as we are, and have come offering an armistice. They would occupy their positions in the north, while we would be free in the south, at peace. While this is a humiliation to allow part of the country to fall to the invaders, we have little choice. When we have rebuilt our strength, we can surely liberate our northern people."
twrchina.174.a:0 "A bitter peace..."

# Politics Stuff #
twrchina.18.t:0 "The House of Cards"
twrchina.18.d:0 "To the outside world, Chiang's regime in China seems as secure as can be. The truth is not quite so simple. The bloated Kuomintang party is made up of various factions, vying for power and held down only by a delicate balancing act by Chiang himself.\n\nIf Chiang is to rule China in his own image as he wants to without opposition from his party, he must consolidate control. The party has grown restless and factional since the destruction of the communists. Perhaps a new war against communism is in order, to unite the country and party behind the Generalissimo..."

twrchina.20.d:0 "While we have begun to properly deal with the last of the communists within our nation, many have already fled into communist-ruled Vietnam, and more continue to follow them. Bolstering the numbers of the Vietnamese army, it is clear they intend to subvert us from the safety across the border.\n\nThis cannot be allowed to continue. Vietnam, in its existence, is a threat to our state, and must be destroyed."

twrchina.21.t:0 "Dealing with the Cliques"
twrchina.21.d:0 "Power in China is divided between the various cliques, and to stay as leader, Chiang must balance their wants and their power to keep them loyal. Many promises will have to be made in backdoor meetings with the various clique leaders, and favours done. Perhaps then, they will be willing to support Chiang in his next goals outside of China's borders..."
twrchina.21.a:0 "Let's hope this works."

twrchina.22.t:0 "The Southern Border"
twrchina.22.d:0 "It is clear where the greatest threat to China lies - to the south, where the surviving Chinese communists have fled into the open arms of the Vietnamese. Ho Chi Minh rules over Asia's strongest socialist state, aiding those traitors who would subvert our rule, preparing to send them back across the border with their support.\n\nIt is clear something must be done. We cannot let a small South East Asian stand to oppose the might of a united China. It is southward our army will look."

Of course, China would be the main beneficiaries of this, but we could nonetheless gain some benefits from accepting, such as the aid of some Chinese manpower and more knowledge of advantageous strategy in the region.

Within minutes, causing a dispute. These commotions attracted more bystanders, and these bystanders were growing more and more agitated, some were even armed with makeshift weapons. With their lives threatened and no reinforcements coming, the police opened fire, igniting a new wave of chaos onto British Hong Kong.\n\nBacked by the Nationalists, gangsters and intellectuals were converted to revolutionaries armed with small arms. While our officers in Hong Kong are attempting to control this situation, the administration is certain that this is the prequel to a Chinese intervention, suggesting that the British should retreat and abandon the uncontrollable city.

The Garrison was mobilized to face the National Revolutionary Army in battle. But the British Forces were overwhelmed, they retreated to Hong Kong Island, abandoning the New Territories and Kowloon.

British Forces realised this and applied guerrilla tactics, securing a major victory in Yuen Long as Chinese forces withered out. And after the lines reached the outskirts of Kowloon, the British launched a counter-offensive, encircling multiple Chinese formations and pushing the invaders back to the border. China, by now facing major internal and external pressure, sued for peace. Britain has managed to secure a victory, with Hong Kong as its prize."

They are trying to intimidate us for a negotiated handover of Macau by paralyzing our control on the city.

Businessmen hurrying to work walk briskly past the gunshots from dark alleys, and policemen studiously avoid certain parts of the city for their own physical safety. The Republic has entered a new era, but it is not necessarily a safer one.\n\nThe many bureaucrats who make up the Political Science Faction do not have long to celebrate their victory in the National Assembly. The real question is what form the victorious Clique will assume to rule the nation. Many of the bureaucrats who form the Clique are themselves in agreement that China is unlikely to ever reach mature democracy in their lifetimes, and support a working relationship with the military as a means to regime stability.\n\nXiong, when asked to represent these bureaucrats, simply says this: the bureaucrats may have ideals tomorrow, but today they have enemies. There is really only one way to ensure that the Clique comes out on top. The gun has never been a comfortable friend, but it is fundamentally reliable. And when it is all over, the military may yet be turned into an instrument of the state's best interests - but they have to survive until that day comes.\n\nZhang Qun is, of course, skeptical. There is a limit, he admits, to how far people can be persuaded - but surely the answer to a state ruled by the gun cannot be more guns. No, the enemies that haunt the Bureaucrats can be dealt with through honeyed words and a few silver dollars here and there. In truth, would a peace won through greased palms not be more preferable than one won through fired arms? Has China not suffered enough?

Amidst the looming threat of the Japanese invasion, Zhang and his compatriots kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek and forced him to sign a truce with the communists. The debacle quickly became a source of embarrassment and consternation for Chiang, not the least of which because it quickly became apparent that Zhang had a point. Just about everyone in the KMT now understands that it was ill-advised for Chiang to prioritize fighting the communists while Japan waged their genocidal war of aggression.\n\nIf we chose to execute Zhang, it's unlikely that anyone in the KMT would object. No one can dispute that he committed treason against the generalissimo. At the same time, there's a general feeling among the party that he was acting in the best interest of his country. If Zhang was pardoned, it may go a ways towards mending past divisions within the party. We could go so far as to offer Zhang a place in the army chief of staff to show our commitment to reconciliation. It's also worth noting that his military expertise would be of great use to us even though he's been out of commission for over a decade."

Here in Guilin, far from the madness that had engulfed Nanjing after the disaster of Vietnam not much could be felt in the new change of course. For Yan, a low level administrator who could consider himself lucky if the party even remembered his name, who pulled the strings in Nanjing at the end of it didn't matter much anyway, the only thing that mattered was whom he had to please next and that was it.\n\nTruly, despite Dr. Sun and Mao's ambition even without the mandate eternal neither the Tao nor the land changed truly. That was until the men from Nanjing. It all began with innocuous slight administrative restructuring, a new overseer there, some old chaps sent into retirement early, some youths joining low level positions out of the sudden.\n\nWhen he began to smell that something was amiss was when his boss had to leave. Overnight the venerable man that had guided and scolded him for over two decades suddenly had been displaced to a rural backwater. In his place a man from Nanjing took his place. Where else could he be from? Despite his best attempts the Jiangsu accent was clear as water on his tongue.\n\nAfterwards they thankfully ended the charade, with the boys from Nanjing holding having infiltrated most of the administration, the mask was largely dropped. With him being suddenly expected to take orders from and show respect to people way below his rank and age. Somewhat embarrassing really considering their special effort beforehand to remain as innocuous as they could. But Yan did not really care nor complain, what he cared for was keeping his job and he had done well to please his new bosses. He felt no shame in such acts, after all such things as Mr. Chen had done were all too common in history."

He began to read it aloud to himself.\n\n\"You are a fraud Chiang Wei-kuo. You claim to be the son of our glorious Generalissimo, yet I know the truth. Your real father is Dai Jitao. Of course this is not the worst part is it? If you still don't take me seriously, I shall simply say two words.\"\n\n\"Shigematsu Kaneko\"\n\n\"I know about her, and what you really are. You will never know how I know, for I know everything about you. I know what's written on every letter you write to your father, even the one you haven't written yet.\"\n\n\"I have official evidence and all it will take is one phone call. Just think of the scandal. Of course, none of that needs to happen, so long as you sign a few documents and officially support myself and the Central Club within the party. If you don't, count your career as good as dead. I look forward to hearing your reply.\nRegards, the CC.\"\n\nChen so wished he could see the teutonic twit's face when he first read it.

Most of the food on offer was a take on a European meal, but a few more traditional meals were also offered. The man had been sure to be very specific with his order as instructed.\n\nFinally a waiter appeared. He approached very gingerly with his food, a simple cashew chicken. The waiter placed it down as quickly as he could, and left. Upon inspection he could spot the almost ridiculous amount of spring onion. Upon tasting it, he could also detect the extra cashew nuts. His curiosity fulfilled, he lifted the plate up and felt the bottom. He felt paper, removed it and opened the letter he found in his hands. It contained two photos.\n\nThe first photo showed a man possibly approaching or just passing 50. His hair is swooped back, yet clearly thinning. He seems to be wearing one of the newer, more fashionable uniforms the man had seen on occasion. Especially around the army offices within Nanjing. Overall the man pictured in the photo seemed a composed, well kept individual. His face seemed to ring some bells, though the man at the booth couldn't name him from memory. The second photo showed something he could name however, the entrance to the Jiangnan Examination Hall. On the back of the first photo was a detailed message.\n\n\"Target will take part in a ceremony at Jiangnan Examination Hall. At 14:30, the target shall take to the stand for a short speech. Make your move when convenient. Equipment provided on location, as promised. Half of your payment will also be found there. The second half will be provided here after the job is done. Destroy this letter upon reading. Happy hunting, the Central Club sends its regards.\"\n\nThe man was satisfied. He took one last look at the photo, finished his food, paid his bill, and made to leave. This was just like the good old days in the mid-1930s.

The charges are brief and uniform, meted out line by line to bruised and battered men, some still dressed in the nightgowns they were wearing as the Blueshirt Police dragged them away. Treason.

The screams as the general is dragged outside silence the entire court. It appears the Blueshirt Police is having its merry way with him. After five minutes or so the voice peters out into a steady whimper, and then into nothingness. The judge continues, a look of mild annoyance on his face.\n\nLi half-smiles to the guards, whispering conspiratorially if they will be let off-shift early tonight for what they are about to do. When his sentence is finally called, he ambles to the blood-spattered courtyard without having to be led by guards, and accepts the cloth bag that will be his final helmet. He is unquestioning through it all, gentle even.\n\nLi Zongren knew, from the moment Dai Li seized power from him, that he and his clique were dead men walking.

We have always been ready to grasp fate by the neck - in 1937, when Generalissimo Chiang was kidnapped, we were ready to seize the apparatus of state. When I was offered the opportunity to lead the Statistics and Investigation Bureau, I took it, because I knew it would only build our power here.\"\n\nThe spymaster nods, as if affirming some hidden truth to his disciples, and continues. \"And now, friends, this is where those patient years of struggle have led us. Chiang is once again indebted to us, and once again history is within our grasp. But opportunity must be grasped by the elect. And I have heard thoughts, yes, even from some of you, that Chiang himself is no longer a member of the elect. Nanjing itself can no longer resist us.

The President is brief: there is really only one item on the agenda.\n\nThe Cliques have been at war with society, Nanjing and each other for forty years. In that time China has nearly fallen to the Japanese, and then to the Communists - the provinces have become ever poorer, and for so little gain. What will happen when China faces its next big threat? Warring generals are a threat not just to themselves, but to the Nation as a whole.\n\nThe President offers one of two solutions: there is a path to peace, he says, and there is a path to stillness. The Cliques can lay down their arms and take up the path of industrialists (with their immense property reserves intact), or they can sign a Letter of Perpetual Armistice promising never to attack the Central Government ever again - the latter option will keep the personal armies the Generals have gathered, but it will also preserve their costs.\n\nAll that remains for the Cliques is to choose: gold, or lead?"

twrchinazongren.3.d:0 "Minutes, Executive Yuan Extraordinary Congress, XX-XX-19XX. Presidential Palace, Nanjing. Typist: Wei Jiangxian, Secretary to the Secretary General of the Republic of China. Attendees: Representatives of Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination and Control Yuan\n\nEXECUTIVE YUAN: By order of the President and Premier of the Republic of China, I declare this Extraordinary Congress open. The agenda is simple today, but that should not comfort the delegates assembled here. We have one task -\n\nJUDICIAL YUAN: Before we address this task, could this Representative bring to the attention of all assembled here the present crisis his department faces? We have recently codified adjustments to our income tax evasion laws, but the Legislative Yuan has decided to sit on its collective laurels - we have not heard from them in two weeks -\n\nLEGISLATIVE YUAN: I will also seize the opportunity to raise some grievances of our own. Until our own Regional Judiciary Reform Bills see the inside of your chambers, we will never grant the Judicial Yuan's request. Indeed, we are assured that one or two of our members have died waiting for this critical Bill to see implementation -\n\nCONTROL YUAN: Silence, both of you! The Control Yuan has its own issues with your departments - before your collective incompetence destroys this Government entirely, we request that you submit your annual personnel audits to us. I assure you, we shall bring you both to heel -\n\nEXECUTIVE: That is ENOUGH! This is the precise issue I have called this meeting to address: we must restructure our administrative apparatus, or this government will fall in on itself. I do not wish to refill some of my most important positions, but it is preferable to being assigned the exalted position of Xinjiang Tax Commissioner, say, or Taiwan Province Agricultural Inspector - and that is assuming the President is in a good mood."

twrchinazongren.4.t:0 "Appease the Masses?"
twrchinazongren.4.d:0 "They say that there are 3 Principles of the Kuomintang Government of China: Civic Nationalism, People's Democracy and The Common Agreement Not To Bring Up Welfare. It might be an understatement, but certainly there is no better way to inflame the Nationalist Government than to bring up the implementation of Min-Sheng, or People's Welfare - and so it is with great trepidation that the National Assembly (not quite a Congress of the Kuomintang, but not terribly different either) gathers to discuss a Civil Welfare Bill put forth by the President and Prime Minister, the first of its kind in a decade. The proposal is ambitious, and as far as the Kuomintang can be said to have a political 'left', considerably slanted in that political direction.\n\nAside from the issue of land reform, almost every conceivable aspect of rural infrastructure and economy has been tackled in this Bill. Salary reforms will target local and international firms, forcing employees to be paid a liveable wage; ambitious pension fund plans will provide a stable basis to support the ever-growing veteran base; additional reforms on the banking system will ensure more equitable access to loans and more generous terms for their perusal. Rural farmers will also receive heavy development incentives to encourage the mechanization of agriculture and limited internal tariffs to ensure they receive high prices for their goods.\n\nIt is so ambitious, in fact, that it is nearly laughed out of the Assembly. As the Representatives gradually realise that the President and Premier are, in fact, deadly serious about this, the discussion switches to disbelief. It is argued that the Bill will provide for China's future by crippling its present, that it will trigger a local banking crisis, that it is robbing the people of China by giving them what they want. The Assembly locks itself in debate for endless hours, pushing for either an acceptance or a rejection of the Bill, and gradually a clear winner emerges."

twrchinazongren.5.d:0 "It's morning in Beijing, a city in turmoil. Garbage has piled up on the streets. Shops and businesses lie ruined, their glass windows smashed in by bricks and stones. Some enterprising ruffian has spray-painted the roads across the business district, and the runoff mixes with the film of petrol that coats the tarmac to produce a horrific smell.\n\nCrowds of youths from the nearby Tsingtau University's Student Unions (now outlawed) clog the streets heading to Tiananmen Square, their demands clear and simple. An end to the Temporary Provisions passed after the Civil War. Immediate transition to democratic elections, ones without Party thugs holding sticks for those who dare vote against their betters. Economic reforms that afford genuine opportunity to the young, not just to the old and rich. A general amnesty to those that languish in the regime's cells all across China.\n\nThese demands are as heartfelt as they are impossible, which would explain why the average activist has turned desperate and embittered. That does not mean, however, that they have given up. Among those trying to rally the crowds is Zhang Zhixin - a Tianjin native, her accent drawls and lilts with the effort of her shouting. At her urging the masses march towards the gate in ordered rows, with buckets held by those at the sides to drench soldiers and policemen.\n\nNot far away, in anonymous drab-grey trucks, men in nondescript coveralls wait for the radio to bark. They distribute cards among themselves, with names and faces printed on their sides. Among them is Zhang Zhixin, student activist and enemy of the state, and those of her friends, and of many others who have held the protests together with their rhetoric and material support. The Republic of China is about to bite back.\n\nThe radio stutters to life - and history turns on a hinge."

twrchinazongren.6.d:0 "It's sunset in Saigon, and the thunder of rickshaws heralds the end of another working day. Sweating laborers struggle to pull businessmen, wives and children across the paved roads, while the occasional car attempts to clear its way through them all. It is an old scene, but in many places jarringly new elements are present: Red banners are arrayed across the buildings of the Commercial District, bearing slogans as clunky as they are optimistic. Party cadres give out pamphlets on the sidewalks, shouting at workers to attend their weekly ideological sessions and laughing with each other in calculated bursts of theatrical joy.\n\nSaigon is a new city now, and it breathes new life into all it touches. But not everyone welcomes the change. In a secluded house in the suburbs, two middle-aged men sit on a couch, playing cards as the cigarette smoke coils above them. The letter from Nanjing sits between them, untouched. Neither of them really want to acknowledge its existence. They know, at least in part, what the letter represents.\n\nOne man throws down a series of cards, and the other groans. \"Goddamnit, Ye, you could've told me you had a royal flush. Playing Da Lao Er with two people? A recipe for disaster.\" Ye grins, almost wolfishly, and reaches for the thin roll of bills placed at the far end of the coffee-table. \"No wonder you want a post money economy…\"As Ye counts his money - its' worthless, old coinage from the Yan'an days - Liu Shaoqi, head of the Communist Party of China's Vietnam Branch, reaches for the letter. He opens it, flicks through the pages. Doubt vanishes - this is exactly what he had expected, but to experience it for real is still a sobering experience.\n\nHe looks at Ye Jianying, former General, now a refugee. All of them are refugees now. \"Pack your things, gather the men we have left. The Guangxi Clique has taken over, and Nanjing wants to talk.\""
twrchinazongren.6.a:0 "And so we shall."
twrchinazongren.7.t:0 "The CCP Accepts"
twrchinazongren.7.d:0 "Nanjing's Foreign Affairs Ministry is quieter than it used to be: now that the West has retreated from major diplomatic support, the Ministry's work is limited to maintaining cordial relations with the Asian nations it considers relevant, and avoiding direct antagonism of the nations it does not. Isolationism might not be healthy in the long run for a country's economy, but it certainly has brought peace to this part of the Republic.\n\nThat is the Ministry, at least. The silent, monstrous machine of covert affairs around and within it, its operations latticed around the nations of Asia, is far more noisy than even the largest Ministry in Nanjing. The Bureau of Investigation and Statistics is everywhere. And its capabilities - well, threats - are limitless. So it is a ZhongTeJu agent who delivers the final report to the President, in the end, and not a diplomat from the Vietnamese Republic.\n\nHis secretary hisses at him to enter a semi-darkened room somewhere in the bowels of Nanjing, and the bemused Li enters, flanked by bodyguards selected for their loyalty to the President first, the Republic second, and the Bureau preferably last. A hooded figure follows, his eyes hidden through aviator glasses. He shakes hands with the President, and having dispensed with the formalities he gets to business.\n\nThe choice for the CCP separatists, he says, was obvious from the get-go. The Vietnam Branch's men are tired, burned out and homesick. Ye Jianying, Liu Shaoqi - they asked for concessions, but in the end they need us more than we need them. We want their support. They want to go home.\n\nThe hooded figure nods simply, writing on a notepad a date and time, and then he is gone. His words hang in the wind: Be ready, President."

twrchinazongren.8.d:0 "The time is 8:36 AM, and the Legislative Yuan is meeting once again to discuss the deposition of the ruling Guangxi Clique's enemies. As Li Zongren is preparing to make a speech to formally begin today's session, the main Yuan building is once again surrounded by demonstrators demanding an end to martial law and further reforms. Within the crowd, sparse groups of blue shirted individuals shuffle their way through unnoticed. Making their way to the restricted side entrance, they quietly overpower the understaffed security detachment. As Zongren finishes his speech to the sound of roaring applause from his compatriots in the Yuan, Dai Li storms into the chambers with a pistol in hand. Rushing to the podium and firing his gun at the ceiling, the Legislative Yuan quickly goes silent as they notice all the exits are blocked by blueshirts. Dai Li announces a dissolution of the Yuan and arrest of the \"decadent kleptocrats\" that have poisoned China for decades. Outraged by the putsch, Zongren storms the stage brandishing a knife. After quickly being hit with a rifle butt and dragged away bleeding, Dai Li orders his followers across the country to seize every major city. by 11:00 AM, Blueshirts loyal to Dai Li are marching in every city square in China."

twrchinazongren.9.t:0 "Meeting with Liu Shaoqi"
twrchinazongren.9.d:0 "Liu Shaoqi winces as he steps onto the tarmac - he's forgotten just how cold Nanjing winds can be. Dressed in his thin overalls and a tattered Party jacket, he cuts a lean figure, half-shivering against the stiff breeze. At least the journalists, he thinks, have been kept off the scene. For all intents and purposes, he's travelling to the country that expelled him as a private resident, albeit one with an entourage of several dozen bedraggled veterans.\n\nLi Zongren, of course, is there to meet him. Liu remembers his broad face from all those years back in the Central Committee days, in heated discussions over the next Japanese incursion, the movement of troops in the South and East. He's grown a little paunchier, the creases around his eyes a little deeper, but otherwise he hasn't aged a day. Now he bounds over, smiling with what must have been practiced ease, calling to Liu to come and see the rest of the city.\n\nThe city is somehow both smaller and larger than Liu remembers from the photos. The buildings are compact, the streets bear traces of reworking and seem narrower somehow in the new skyscrapers' shadows - but the city is teeming with life, from the government bureaucrats to the businessmen running through the alleyways. It's all he can do not to stare out the window.\n\nAs their convoy pulls up outside the Presidential Palace, Li pulls out a rumpled dossier, tossing it with almost careless ease. Liu thumbs through the pages, frowning.\"These terms seem a little, well, generous. I had not expected the right to create our own political party, nor did I expect full amnesty to our lower ranked members-\"\n\n\"I wouldn't call them generous if I were you.\" Zongren is staring straight ahead, and the jolliness has vanished from his features. \"If you sign this, you'll be declaring the legitimacy of our government. From what I understand of you Reds, this statement is as good as a surrender.\" The President turns to him, face cold. \"And I'll make sure all of China knows it.\""

Liu Shaoqi, the party's present leader met Li Zongren in person within the Presidential Palace to discuss the armistice. According to the President's office, CCP members will be granted amnesty and be allowed to return to China. They will be granted the right to organize their own political party. In return for this however, Shaoqi has agreed to formally recognize the Guangxi regime as the legitimate government of China. With news reporters from around the world present to observe the event, Shaoqi approached the press and stated \"With this agreement our tired and homesick comrades from all over the world can finally return to their families.\""

twrchinazongren.11.d:0 "Excerpt, Memoirs Of A Traitor, Dong Cunrui, Tsingtau University Press\n\nOnce, when I was a child, my father caught me trying to throw stones at birds clustered in a neighbour's garden. I remember thinking that if I threw hard enough, and if I could hit the right spot on some defenseless bird, I would have to crawl through the pickets of the fence to retrieve it. Then, I believed, I would stand in the garden like it was my own, feeling the grass and the mud on my toes. It would belong to me, and I to it.\n\nAnd yet when my father understood this, he did not deny me this as punishment - he merely promised that I would get the chance to walk through the world like I owned it, one day. On that day, he said, it would not matter whether I was rich or poor, a soldier or a craftsman or a thief. I would be one with all the men and women who walk through this life and, for a brief, shining instant in time, find their place within it.\n\nWhen we heard the news from Shaoqi and his deputies, that instant came to me. I fell on the floor, weeping with joy, and it was quite a while before I could be calmed down. Even as the terms and conditions were read aloud to us, I felt the life coming back to me in that crowded repurposed shophouse in Saigon. The world had long shifted away from my feet, and at last it was moving towards some semblance of order.\n\nOld cadres, ripped from us by the ravages of war and reconstruction. Our rivers and mountains, after the long nightmare of the Defeat, finally regained. Even the opportunity to start anew, a new Party, free of the gunfire that stained us all after these years of struggle. And a just, lasting peace, one where we could slough off the stains of the past.\n\nAs I watched President Li sign the Charter of Armistice, I felt my heart lift, and for an instant I was standing in the garden, just like I had dreamed all those years ago - my feet muddy with earth, my soul blessedly free."

twrchinaps.1.d:0 "The halls of the Presidential Palace echo with footsteps old and new. It is a harried drumbeat for a melody that seems increasingly out of control. China's vast network of money and old power was long the source of stability for the Political Science Clique: money fed the soldiers, power kept them in line. Money quietened the governors, and power silenced them. Money and power. They are a winning recipe, if used in moderation. But the Clique is approaching the limits of moderation.\n\nDemonstrations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou every other week, fuelled by discontent over elections that end in results contradictory to public sentiment. An antsy business community watches as the third consecutive motion to protect key banks from financial accountability stalls in the National Assembly. A wave of public nostalgia for an order that at least pretended to be a party of the People. In faraway Urumqi, a Governor's mansion is burnt to the ground, the third incident of arson in a month. An old banner, long forbidden and long desired, spreads its hammer-sickled face to the four winds on its burning roof.\n\nThe Bureaucrats, like men on a sinking ship, rush to fill the holes. A member of the Principled Opposition, if it can be called opposition at all, will replace President [CHI.GetLeader] as he bows low in the nation's television screens. But who will that member be?\n\nJiang Menglin, agricultural expert and ex-President of Zhejiang University, is a reluctant candidate, distant from even opposition politics. He will accept only because the Clique keeps tabs on his personal finances, but he will accept in the end. Wang Shijie, on the other hand, is enthusiastic: an old stooge from the KMT days, he has proved invaluable in whipping his party into covert collaboration with the Clique. It is a game of silent complicity - the only question is whose face will be on the coinage."

He has not seen his wife in months.\n\nHe has begun to entertain the possibility that he might die without seeing her, or she without seeing him, when the doorbell rings. A friend-turned-enemy: Zhang Qun is waiting for him, smile limber and greasy as a pork-knuckle slice hanging from a butcher's shop.\n\nHe has in hand a few papers, gathered in a dossier for easy reference: attached to some of them are pictures, charts and rows of numbers. Reading them, Chiang's hands begin to tremble. It is suddenly hard to focus with the spike that has embedded itself in his chest. The Chiang Family has lost its patriarch. Now, it appears, it might lose everything else.\n\nZhang Qun nods, almost sagacious. He gestures to the charts, speaking of the obvious: unless something is done, the Chiang family is about to lose everything it still has. Then he leans closer, whispering that there is something Chiang can still do to save them. Something he can do for his successor, his old friend. Otherwise...well, even an old friend has limits, does he not?\n\nWhen Chiang reappears, he seems - different, somehow. Witnesses report an almost artificial cheerfulness on the part of the ex-President, and his praise of the Political Science Clique seems almost - forced, as if through bitter tears.

Yet for now the loudest noise was the ruffling of leaves from the trees on the schoolyard outside, the low noise was much merciful compared to the heavy clattering of windows or screams as umbrellas were yanked from hands usually worming its way into his skull as he desperately tried to study for his final exams.\n\nPen scratched ink on paper as the setting sun continuously shrouded the classroom in darkness. Beside him there were only a handful of other students sitting in the creeping twilight, like him they could not afford the luxury of electricity at home. A decade old lamp screeched to life as his pupils, used to the fading twilight, accustomed to it. He wrote on, noise wormed again into his skull as one of the boys noisily ate his lunch’s leftovers, he barely endured. The noise stopped. The sun vanished behind the hills, a pair of heavy steps rang from outside. He tensed, the steps were drowned out by the intensifying wind. Pens scratched on paper once more, then he heard them again this time from inside the building. Windows clattered loudly and they were gone again.\n\nThe the door flew open, outside stood three men in blue uniforms. Ink splattered over the floor as one of the girls dropped her pen, nobody said anything. The boy with the leftover lunch slowly backed away from the door. A nod, two of the men stormed towards the boy. A punch flew, then another. Blood from a broken nose and shattered jaw sprayed onto white paper. They dragged the boy out, the man in the doorstep gave a curt bow and they were alone once more.\n\nShaking he began writing again, ink mixing with blood as the wind carried muffled screams from outside."

Subtlety was truly not Nanjing’s strength. At least they were not torturing them yet with those horrid songs they claimed the Marshal had written themselves, his son had complained endlessly over how the japanese singers on the radio had so much better recording equipment than the chinese ones. Defeated again apparently. All the different types of crap they hurled out still amazed him, posters, flags, portraits, slings and most of all simple consumer goods with the KMT or Chiang logo slapped onto.\n\nYet despite it all, he did like his job. Pay was good, working conditions above average and for once his bosses cared more for the quality of the work than its quantity. For nobody wanted a banner which misspelled the three principles of the people or worse yet a portrait with the President’s face horribly misfigured. And all it had cost him was a little donation to the mayor's office, truly some things never changed.\n\nSo he stood in the factory's courtyard, smoking a cigarette adored with the white on blue sun and the President’s face on its package.

Just after they had won their final triumph over the red menace, after days of celebration in Nanjing's ballrooms and streets, he had found a moment of quiet in Dr Sun’s acrylic eyes.\n\nNow they stood triumphant once more, his rivals dealt with one way or another and the Republic secured. And secure it would be, as in the office of Eternal President, created just for him today, he would rule until his death.

In a sharp pivot from his Western-friendly tendencies, Hu demands the implantation of "Chinese-styled democracy" across Asia - and the sponsorship of foreign movements across Asia opposed to both Western liberalism and Communism. The American Government has condemned the paper as an unacceptable violation of diplomatic protocol, but Hu Shih has defended his statements as a necessary move for China to build an Asia "free from tyranny and ready for democracy on their own terms"."
