IRE_dream_of_ireland:0 "Dream of a United Ireland"
IRE_dream_of_ireland_desc:0 "The nationalism that plagued Ireland has only increased in recent years. Without a doubt, the British failure at Dunkirk and the short war against Germany has created the image of a weakened and disgraced British Empire, and Irish nationalists are using this as a tool to drive their message of Irish unification and republicanism, both in the Republic and north of the island."
IRE_collaboration_politics:0 "The Price of Freedom"
IRE_collaboration_politics_desc:0 "We had no choice but to cooperate with the Germans. Many citizens and politicians are displeased with this decision, but this is all for the greater good of Ireland, is it not?"
IRE_puppet_regime_collaboration:0 "Collaborationist Regime"
IRE_puppet_regime_collaboration_desc:0 "Thanks to our German partners, Ireland can finally see the full light of nationalism. However, many citizens are still disgruntled by this change of affairs, which is endangering the stability of the new, reborn Irish State."

twrireland.1.t:0 "1954 Irish General Election"
twrireland.1.d:0 "The 1954 Election is upon us. With Fianna Fáil slowly losing popularity, the possibilities of a new government formed by other political parties have been growing. Fine Gael and the Labour Party have been discussing the terms of a coalition government, in an attempt at removing the Fianna Fáil from ruling position. The Fianna Fáil has responded with their own attempts of acquiring support from Irish Nationalists, preaching the ideas of stability and unification to their many supporters."
twrireland.1.a:0 "Fianna Fáil scores a minor victory!"
twrireland.1.b:0 "Fine Gael scores a minor victory!"
twrireland.1.c:0 "A coalition government is formed!"
twrireland.2.t:0 "Fianna Fáil Elected"
twrireland.2.d:0 "Fianna Fáil, the ruling party of Ireland has been re-elected with a narrow victory against it's oppositions. Éamon de Valera has maintained his position as Taoiseach, with Fine Gael has formed an opposition coalition. Campaigning on the platform of stability and nationalism, Éamon de Valera has promised the Irish people economic growth and political stability, while the opposition is accussing de Valera of election fraud and pandering to dangerous ideals similar to the National Socialists during Weimar Germany."
twrireland.2.a:0 "Another term for the Fianna Fáil."
twrireland.3.t:0 "Fine Gael Elected"
twrireland.3.d:0 "Fine Gael has been serving the Republic as the opposition, and with much campaigning, Fine Gael has managed to score a narrow victory against Fianna Fáil. Using progress and changes as their election platform, the newly elected Taoiseach Richard Mulcahy has promised new reforms and alternatives to the traditional policies of the Fianna Fáil. Éamon de Valera will now serve as the leader of opposition, telling the press that Fianna Fáil will do whatever it's needed to prevent Fine Gael from ruining the Republic of Ireland with senseless reforms."
twrireland.3.a:0 "Fine Gael is in!"
twrireland.4.t:0 "The Second Inter-Party Government"
twrireland.4.d:0 "While the Fianna Fáil was able to secure a slight majority in the public election, the Fine Gael-Labour-Clann na Talmhan coalition was proclaimed, and together, they held more seats than Fianna Fáil. And with it, a coalition government, led by Fine Gael has been established, nicked by journalists as the Second Inter-Party Government. As a condition of the compromise, the leader of Fine Gael was not assigned as the Taoiseach, instead they have chosen to appoint John A. Costello as the Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBeing a condition, it is expected many policies and reforms would require extensive compromising between all parties in order to have a chance of passing the Oireachtas."
twrireland.4.a:0 "Alright."
