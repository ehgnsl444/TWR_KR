africa.1.t:0 "The Lozi People Request Tribal Autonomy"
africa.1.d:0 "When Zambia was colonised by the British, the Lozi people were granted autonomy from the rest of the territory, which was primarily Bemba and Chewa. The Lozi, also known as the Barotse, were allowed to retain their King, as well as some sense of self-determination under Britain. \n\nNow that Zambia is independent, however, the future of the Lozi people is uncertain. For this reason, the king of Barotseland, Yeta IV, has proposed an agreement, termed quite simply the Barotse Agreement of [GetYear], where they will maintain most of the authority granted by the British, including native courts and exclusive rights to nature by the Lozi. Some in the Zambian government are against this agreement, feeling that Zambia must be united as one nation. Others, however, worry that refusing the agreement could lead to Barotseland splitting from Zambia. What will we tell King Yeta?"
africa.1.a:0 "Lozi autonomy will continue. Accepted."
africa.1.b:0 "Declined - Zambia is one country."
africa.2.t:0 "Barotseland Declares Independence!"
africa.2.d:0 "Following our refusal to grant autonomy for the Lozi people, they have unilaterally declared independence as the Kingdom of Barotseland, under King Yeta IV. After we demanded that they rescind their declaration, they not only refused, but said that if we wanted to retake Barotseland, we would have to fight them on the field of battle for it. \n\nWe have already begun to mobilise our forces. It seems that Zambia, already a fragile union, is on the brink of war, as the lines of battle are drawn. The choice is simple: between a united Zambia, or a free Barotseland once and for all."
africa.2.a:0 "Zambia shall remain whole!"
africa.2.b:0 "Freedom for Barotseland!"
africa.3.t:0 "The Lozi Accept Our Decision"
africa.3.d:0 "After our refusal to guarantee the continuation of autonomy for Barotseland, many in the government were fearful of an uprising in the western region of Zambia. However, it seems that our fears have, thankfully, not come true, as Yeta IV, King of Barotseland, quietly accepted our decision. While we are still on high alert for possibly dangerous missteps, we can at least relax somewhat, knowing that there is not as much of a chance for an organised insurrection as we anticipated."
africa.3.a:0 "Wonderful."
africa.4.t:0 "Zimbabwean ZAPU Revolt"
africa.4.d:0 "Deeply concerning news has come in recently from our Zimbabwean territories. It seems that the communist Zimbabwe African People's Union, or ZAPU, has taken up arms against our government to fight for their independence. \n\nLed by Joshua Nkomo, ZAPU has declared the independence of Zimbabwe, and that they would fight to their deaths to free their land. In response, we have already mobilised our armed forces in preparation for the suppression of the region."
africa.4.a:0 "We must stay together!]"
africa.4.b:0 "Blessed be the land of Zimbabwe!"
africa.5.t:0 "Rhodesian Revolt"
africa.5.d:0 "Chaotic news from our southern territories of Zimbabwe as it seems that many White Rhodesians, furious at the idea of not being the most powerful group in a majority non-White state, have risen up in an uprising, declaring "Rhodesia" to be independent! Led by one Clifford Dupont, a former British Royal Artillery officer, the Rhodesians want to establish their own state, under white minority rule. \n\nWe have already begun to mobilise our forces, in order to regain control of the area. According to reports, the Rhodesians have already seized control over several key areas in Zimbabwe, and are preparing their own militias for the coming fight."
africa.5.a:0 "A White Man in our Africa?"
africa.5.b:0 "Rhodesians never die!"
africa.5.c:0 "A White Man in our Africa?"
africa.5.e:0 "Rhodesians never die!"
africa.6.t:0 "A New Name for a New Nation"
africa.6.d:0 "What's in a name? Sometimes, a name means nothing, merely being descriptive of what's truly inside. Other times, though, it means everything, from identity to how others view you. Such is the case with South Sudan. \n\nSudan is a nation of Arabs, not unlike Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, or Iraq. South Sudan, however, could not be further from the truth - our nation was founded on a rejection of the notions of Arab dominance that would inevitably occur if we were part of Sudan. So, we have decided to change our name, to something that better reflects our status as an independent country. \n\nFour choices lie before us: Kushland, after the ancient Kingdom of Kush that dominated the Nile. Juwama, a combination of Juba, Wau, and Malakal, our country's three largest cities. Ima-Toj, after the indigenous names of Imatong and Tocland that are used for the region. Finally, there is the choice of the Nile Republic, after the great river that flows through our nation and waters Africa. What shall we choose?"
africa.6.a:0 "Kushland, after the ancient empire!"
africa.6.b:0 "Juwama, after our three largest cities!"
africa.6.c:0 "Ima-Toj, after the people of this land!"
africa.6.e:0 "The Nile Republic, after the great river of Africa!"
africa.7.t:0 "The idea of Tanzania"
africa.7.d:0 "The president of Tanganyika, Julius Nyerere, proposes an Ujaamist idea for uniting Zanzibar and his country, Tanganyika, into a single entity - Tanzania. Tanganyika and our country, Zanzibar, have long been separated only by religion, but united by the brotherhood of our Swahili folk. It would be of the utmost benefit for all of East Africa, and especially Tanganyika and Zanzibar to unite under a strong, independent Pan-African secular state to lead their people into a bright future."
africa.7.a:0 "Yes, we accept."
africa.7.b:0 "Why do we need Tanzania?"
africa.8.t:0 "Zanzibar accepts"
africa.8.d:0 "Zanzibar has accepted to unite with Tanganyika into Tanzania. This is a great day for Africa!"
africa.8.a:0 "Amazing!"
africa.9.t:0 "Zanzibar refuses"
africa.9.d:0 "Zanzibar has refused to unite with Tanganyika into Tanzania. This is a disappointment for all of East Africa, and another reason for everyone to laugh at us."
africa.9.a:0 "Disappointing."
africa.10.t:0 "The Fate of Sudan"
africa.10.d:0 "The 'winds of change' are blowing in Sudan. Ruled as a 'condominium' between Britain and Egypt for almost 60 years, the region known as Sudan sees various clamourings for independence. It is clear we must withdraw from the country to avoid the costs of attempting to hold onto it.\n\nOne of the first nations in Africa to achieve independence from the UK, we must consider how to handle the process. The historic links to Egypt make some suggest that a referendum on joining Egypt is the best option. Others say that Sudan must be given independence as a united nation. Yet more say that the South of the country, culturally and ethnically distinct from the mostly Arab rest of the nation, should be given independence in its own right."
africa.10.a:0 "Organise a referendum on Egypt."
africa.10.b:0 "Create a united Sudan."
africa.10.c:0 "Partition Sudan."
africa.11.t:0 "Sudan Referendum Results"
africa.11.d:0 "The vote has been held, and the results are coming in on whether Sudan will join Egypt or become an independent nation..."
africa.11.a:0 "And the results are..."
africa.12.t:0 "Secessions in Sudan"
africa.12.d:0 "Though Sudan has voted to join our nation in a referendum organised by the British, a triumph to be sure, some groups in the south and in the Darfur region are declaring independent states, refusing to recognise our annexation of Sudan. Our forces and institutions are struggling to take control of Sudan as it is, and there is little that we can do about this."
africa.12.a:0 "Let them leave."
