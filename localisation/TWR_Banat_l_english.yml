#Events
twrbanat.1.t:0 "Gatehouse of the Balkans"
twrbanat.1.d:0 "After the formation of the Serbian Military Command, the region of Yugoslav Banat has been under a German minority regime. Banat was left in this state of temporary occupation until the Schutzstaffel suggested turning Banat, alongside the Occupied Crimea, into the envisioned SS Ordenstaats. This deal was pushed through with the help of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, and the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division "Prinz Eugen" was assigned as the Banat's defence force, and granted near absolute power to enforce the model Aryan settlement. The Swabian Group Leader, Sepp Janko, was appointed Governor, and has been ruling with brute force ever since. While Banat is largely in a constant state of chaos, with the backing of Germania, Banat has marched on in times of turmoil, but how long can Banat last if things were to change?"
twrbanat.1.a:0 "Forwards, Prinz Eugen!"

twrbanatser.1.t:0 "Banat Intimidation"
twrbanatser.1.d:0 "The SS Thugs in Banat are launching a minor invasion of Serbian borderlands. They are clearly attempting to test our limits, and while it might be logical to enforce our borders, the condition of our States Guard is questionable, and we might suffer more from responding than ignoring."
twrbanatser.1.a:0 "Preserve our honour, respond with force!"
twrbanatser.1.b:0 "Issue a diplomatic protest but do nothing."

twrbanat.2.t:0 "The Banat Terror"
twrbanat.2.d:0 "Sepp Janko has ordered a mass raid in the name of a 'security inspection' of the local population, pushing Banat into yet another dark age. Thousands of natives were arrested and publicly executed, with Sepp Janko himself exclaiming that this wave of public executions is just the start to more 'examples' to be set."
twrbanat.2.a:0 "It MUST be done..."

twrbanat.3.t:0 "The Second Wave"
twrbanat.3.d:0 "During a midnight raid, thousands of locals were once again rounded up and arrested. Villages were sacked, towns were halved and families were torn apart. The list of chosen 'bandits' is seemingly random, but reasonings are swept aside in favour of brute force, and the rulers are rejoiced about these actions."
twrbanat.3.a:0 "Go on..."

twrbanat.4.t:0 "End of the Terror"
twrbanat.4.d:0 "After thousands of dead locals, Sepp Janko has declared Banat "One step closer to Germanhood". And to celebrate, Sepp Janko ordered the last arrest orders of another 2,000 locals for public execution. The locals are too shellshocked to react, and with no food and an aboslute police state, any sense of hope in the local population has been crushed beyond the point of no return."
twrbanat.4.a:0 "Three salutes to Prinz Eugen!"

twrbanat.5.t:0 "Serbia Responds"
twrbanat.5.d:0 "The Serbian State Guards have mounted defences against our invasion force. The Schutzstaffel Command has made it clear that failure is not an option, and reinforcements have been sent to strike against the Serbian Resistance as soon as possible."
twrbanat.5.a:0 "For Prinz Eugen!"

twrbanat.6.t:0 "Banat Victory"
twrbanat.6.d:0 "The incompetent State Guards have failed to stop the Banat tide! The flag of Prinz Eugen flies over several Serbian border towns. The Serbain Government has called for a ceasefire, and Banat was allowed to keep the gained land and the resources within it. Overall, a major victory for Prinz Eugen!"
twrbanat.6.a:0 "Hurrah!"

twrbanat.7.t:0 "Schutzstaffel Defeated"
twrbanat.7.d:0 "The Schutzstaffel Divisions were driven out of Serbia when State Guards' reinforcements arrived. When Serbia was threatening to invade Banat soil, Schutzstaffel Officers entered into a ceasefire with Serbia, ending the conflict between the two."
twrbanat.7.a:0 "Respect the decision but... get the firing squads."

twrbanat.8.t:0 "Serbian Victory"
twrbanat.8.d:0 "Our State Guards have pushed back the SS thugs! The borders are resecured and fortified, and Serbia has stood tall against the tyranny of the Banat SS, a great propaganda tool for Serbian unity."
twrbanat.8.a:0 "Like the heros of Belgrade, we stand!"

twrbanat.9.t:0 "Serbian Defeat"
twrbanat.9.d:0 "Even with our superiority in manpower, Serbia stood no chance. Our forces were utterly destroyed by the strong-willed Schutzstaffel Soldiers, and the loss of border towns has greatly damaged national unity. The government's legitimacy is once again under fire."
twrbanat.9.a:0 "Censor the pre-...we're fucked."

twrbanat.21.t:0 "Failed Pillage Mission"
twrbanat.21.d:0 "Our attempts at raiding a border village has ended in failure, with the loss of many soldiers. Our men left empty handed, with no loot gathered."

twrbanat.22.t:0 "Border Armory Raided"

twrbanat.23.t:0 "Grand Theft Auto - Banat"
twrbanat.23.d:0 "With skilled infiltration, our Schutzstaffel raiders were able to secure and relocate dozens of APCs to Banat. These APCs will be recoloured and deployed as part of the Banat Defence Force."
twrbanat.23.a:0 "Good work, Specialists!"

twrbanat.24.t:0 "Raided Equipment"
twrbanat.24.d:0 "The Schutzstaffel raiders were able to sack a border fortification, stealing artillery equipment and other regular military grade supplies, expanding the Banat stockpile once again."

twrbanat.10.t:0 "Italian Mafia Offers Tribute"
twrbanat.10.d:0 "Sepp Janko was greeted with an Italian man, claiming to be a member of the an 'Italian Ore Mining Company', in reality just a mob boss for the Italian Mafia. With a suitcase filled with money, the boss seeks to purchase 'Operation rights' within Banat, and due to the largely 'Business-friendly environment', the permission was granted and they can now operate within Banat."
twrbanat.10.a:0 "We like our Speerconomics here."

twrbanat.11.t:0 "German Gangs Protest"
twrbanat.11.d:0 "One of Banat's biggest 'Business partner', the German 'Bakery', issued a strong protest to Sepp Janko after the reports regarding Italian rival groups being granted rights to operate within the same region, which is a major competition for their interest. They warn that Banat will pay dearly for this idoitic decision."
twrbanat.11.a:0 "Business is business."

twrbanat.12.t:0 "Firefight in Capital"
twrbanat.12.d:0 "Hours ago, a firefight broke out in Veliki Beckerek, confuscion spreaded when the firefight appeared to be between three parties. After inspection, the Italian Gangs and German Gangs appeared to have sparked a firefight due to arguments, with the Schutzstaffel Security Forces caught in the cross fire. Sepp Janko has made his personal order, stating that the Government shall not intervene in the looming gang war."
twrbanat.12.a:0 "They will figure it out."

twrbanat.13.t:0 "Assassination of a Mob Boss"
twrbanat.13.d:0 "Amongst the brooming tension between the Italian and German Gangs, a group of German gangsters ambushed a Italian regional leader, shooting up and burning his car, killing him on spot. This marks the start of a gang conflict which would surely devastate Banat."
twrbanat.13.a:0 "Just let them kill themselves."

twrbanat.14.t:0 "Factory Bombed"
twrbanat.14.d:0 "A new target of the gang war, a factory containing members associated with one of the gangs has been destroyed by bombs and arsonists. Devastating the local economy."
twrbanat.14.a:0 "Scheisse!"

twrbanat.15.t:0 "Planned Shootings"
twrbanat.15.d:0 "Part of the gang war, members associated with both of the gangs were killed in a string of coordinated attack, targeting valuable members of a gang or citizens under their jurisdiction."
twrbanat.15.a:0 "Life goes on."

twrbanat.16.t:0 "Italian Victory"
twrbanat.16.d:0 "The Italian Mafia has effectively crushed the German leadership, breaking their structure.

twrbanat.16.a:0 "What a fight."

twrbanat.17.t:0 "German Victory"
twrbanat.17.d:0 "The German Mafia has effectively crushed the Italian leadership, breaking their structure.
