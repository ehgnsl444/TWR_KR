SYR_Greater_Syrian_Dream:0 "Dream of a Greater Syria"
SYR_Greater_Syrian_Dream_desc:0 "The dream of the Syrian people is expanding Syria to its natural borders. All across the Levant, Syria was robbed and divided by foreign powers, crippling the nation to its current, miserable state. The SSNP seeks to unify all of Greater Syria and ensure the greatness of Syria lasts for a thousand years."
SYR_Lebanese_Unrest:0 "Lebanese Unrest"
SYR_Lebanese_Unrest_desc:0 "Due to the major conflict of interest within the two regions of Lebanon and Syria, the Lebanese people resent being treated as a mere part of Syria, making the Lebanon region ever more rebellious against Syrian rule. Nationalist groups seek to gain greater rights, while some call for total separation from the Syrian State."
SYR_Lebanese_Unrest_2:0 "Lebanese Unrest"
SYR_Lebanese_Unrest_2_desc:0 "Due to the major conflict of interest within the two regions of Lebanon and Syria, the Lebanese people resent being treated as a mere part of Syria, making the Lebanon region ever more rebellious against Syrian rule.

SYR_Opposition_Parties:0 "Underground Opposition"
SYR_Opposition_Parties_desc:0 "After the Nazi-backed revolution that overthrew the Republic, Syria under the SSNP outlawed every other political entities and declared them 'Enemies against the state', but failed to destroy them completely, leaving many underground groups advocating for different ideologies, such as the Pan-Arabic moderate Nationalists and Republicans."
SYR_Opposition_Parties_2:0 "Lingering Underground Opposition"
SYR_Opposition_Parties_2_desc:0 "Syria has enacted a comprehensive campaign to root out remaining opposition groups within the country, which has been met by some success. However, destroying ideas is much harder than destroying countries or people, and the opposition will always remain under the surface, a thorn in the side to Saadeh's regime."
SYR_Enemies_On_All_Fronts:0 "Enemies on All Fronts"
SYR_Enemies_On_All_Fronts_desc:0 "Syria is surrounded, with hostile regimes all around us, banding together in an attempt to stop the destiny of the Syrian people. The Syrian Army has been drilled to reclaim and defend Syrian soil for years, and they are ready for the fight when it arrives."
SYR_Oversized_Army:0 "Inefficient Army"
SYR_Oversized_Army_desc:0 "Under the militaristic government of the SSNP, the Syrian State has expanded its army at a rapid rate, buying weapons from Europe overtly and covertly, despite western attempts to halt the flow. With a massive army, the equipment of the units are disorganised, with different variants of equipment ranging from obselete German equipment to cheaply purchased captured Soviet equipment from the German-Soviet War."
SYR_No_More_Kurdish_Opposition:0 "No More Kurdish Opposition"
SYR_Fortress_Doctrine:0 "Fortress Doctrine"

##Events##
twrsyria.0.t:0 "The Syrian State"
twrsyria.0.d:0 "Nazi Germany has always had few allies outside of Europe since the defeat of Japan, but Syria has certainly been one of them.\n\nBefore the European wars, Syria had been a colony of the French, seized from the dying Ottoman Empire at the end of the First World War. As France was defeated and Britain subdued by the 1940 war, Syria initially remained a colony of the new French State. However, it was not long before the SSNP, led by Antoun Saadeh and inspired by the seemingly successful fascist movements of Europe, conspired to seize power. When the coup did come, it was backed wholeheartedly by both the Germans and Italians, with the French relatively powerless to resist.\n\nSince then, Saadeh has led his new Syrian regime with an iron fist. Crushing dissent of all sorts, Saadeh's ambitions extend not just within Syria's current borders, but towards an idealistic 'Greater Syria' spanning across the Levant, from Suez to Khuzestan. Few take these ambitions seriously, and whether Saadeh will seriously attempt to realise them is an open question. However, as recent history has shown, even the most impossible seeming plans of rapid expansion through war can end up becoming a reality."
twrsyria.0.a:0 "Long live Syria!"
twrsyria.1.t:0 "Declare Greater Syria"
twrsyria.1.d:0 "It has been decided that, for the Syrian state to survive and thrive, it must expand. The dream of Greater Syria, a pan-Syrian nation spanning across the fertile crescent and the Levant, must be created, by force of arms if necessary, before our glorious state can be complete."
twrsyria.1.a:0 "Glory to Syria!"
twrsyria.2.t:0 "Attacking the Hashemite Monarchies"
twrsyria.2.d:0 "Preparations are finally complete. Now is the time that we can strike against the monarchies of Iraq and Jordan, backed by their western imperialist puppet-masters. The dream of Greater Syria can finally begin to be realised!"
twrsyria.2.a:0 "Glory to Syria!"
twrsyria.3.t:0 "Victory in Arabia"
twrsyria.3.d:0 "Our latest conquest has been a success - we have defeated the Saudi Kingdom of Arabia, knocking out a regional rival and uprooting western imperialist influence in the Middle East. Now, comes the question of what to do with it.\n\nUnfortunately, the House of Saud is very well rooted in this region, and there are almost no political figures other than members of the royal family. Therefore, we will install Prince Faisal, a powerful Saudi Prince and claimant to the throne, as a puppet king. In return for our backing, he will grant legitimacy to our hegemony over the region, and give us a cut of the wealth and resources of the Arabian desert."
twrsyria.3.a:0 "Excellent"
twrsyria.4.t:0 "Victory in Iran"
twrsyria.4.d:0 "We have defeated the Persians on the battlefield and captured their capital Tehran. Now, with our position secured, we can sign a peace with Iran and seize the border territories we have claimed as part of Greater Syria, including the oil-rich region of Khuzestan. The defeated Iranians have no choice but to accept."
twrsyria.4.a:0 "Excellent"
twrsyria.5.t:0 "The Syrian Disaster"
twrsyria.5.d:0 "Our forces have been comprehensively defeated by the Syrian invaders. We have been pushed back, and even our capital Tehran has fallen to the attackers. With such a disaster, we have no choice but to accept Saadeh's peace terms, ceding the border regions in the west of our country including the oil-rich region of Khuzestan.\n\nFor now, this is a disaster for Iran. We can only hope we can reclaim these lands in the future."
twrsyria.5.a:0 "A bitter peace."
twrsyria.6.t:0 "Victory in Turkey"
twrsyria.6.d:0 "Though they attacked us first, we have driven away the Turks and captured their capital Ankara. Now, with our position secured, we can sign a peace with Turkey and seize the border territories we have claimed as part of Greater Syria. With our forces occupying so much of the country, they will have no choice but to accept."
twrsyria.6.a:0 "Excellent"
twrsyria.7.t:0 "The Syrian Disaster"
twrsyria.7.d:0 "Our forces have been comprehensively defeated by the Syrian invaders. We have been pushed back, and even our capital Ankara has fallen to the enemy. With such a disaster, we have no choice but to accept Saadeh's peace terms, ceding the border regions in the south-east of our country to Syria.\n\nFor now, this is a disaster for Turkey. We can only hope we can reclaim these lands in the future."
twrsyria.7.a:0 "A bitter peace."
twrsyria.8.t:0 "Victory Against Syria"
twrsyria.8.d:0 "We have defeated the Syrians and crushed Saadeh's brutal and mad regime. Now, the time has come to restore order to the regions he ruled over, as well as asserting our rule. We must create the new order in the Middle East.\n\n(Range of choices will depend on circumstances of victory)"

twrsyria.8.c:0 "Let the Arab nations be"
twrsyria.9.t:0 "Victory Against Middle East"
twrsyria.9.d:0 "We have defeated the enemies Eastward and crushed their brutal and mad regime. Now, the time has come to restore order to the regions he ruled over, as well as asserting our rule. We must create the new order in the Middle East, while at the same time asserting Iran's position as the new guardian of order."
twrsyria.9.a:0 "'Liberate' the Arabs from themselves."

twrsyria.10.t:0 "Return Syrian Territories"
twrsyria.10.d:0 "Now that Saadeh has been toppled and a sane regime has been installed in the new Syrian Republic, we have the opportunity to return territories in Syria that we occupy. Should we do so?"
twrsyria.10.a:0 "Return the Territories"
twrsyria.10.b:0 "Maintain our occupation"
twrsyria.11.t:0 "War with Syria lost"
twrsyria.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, our inability to defeat the Syrians in a timely manner has lead to our political leaders accepting defeat. Kuwait is lost."
twrsyria.11.a:0 "No!"
twrsyria.12.t:0 "Victory Over Britain"
twrsyria.12.d:0 "With the seizing of Cyprus, we have won total victory over the British. The war is over!"
twrsyria.12.a:0 "Forward, Syria!"
twrsyria.13.t:0 "War with Syria lost"
twrsyria.13.d:0 "Unfortunately, with Kuwait and Cyprus both lost, the war with Syria is as good as over."

SYR_Pressing_the_Southern_Claims_desc:0 "The first step in achieving our national dream is a southward expansion.

SYR_Liberating_the_Levant:0 "Striking the Hashemites"

SYR_Crushing_the_Saudis_desc:0 "The Saudis have long been collaborators in Britain's quest to suck the life force out of West Asia in general, and Syria in particular.

SYR_Testing_the_British:0 "Testing the British"
