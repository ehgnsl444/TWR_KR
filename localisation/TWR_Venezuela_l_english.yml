twrvenezuela.1.t:0 "Coup Attempt Against Jimenez"
twrvenezuela.1.d:0 "After 2 years in power, the people had had enough of Pérez Jiménez and his iron fisted rule. In the cities, the citizens protest, calling for Democracy to come to Venezuela while rebels have already begun to storm buildings of the government. Houses of government officials are being looted and the headquarters of the El Heraldo newspaper are in flames. \n\nA sizeable part of the army is still on our side and if this situation persists, we can send them in to take out the rebels. Such a decision though would put us in the spotlight as a regime based on death. Otherwise, the best we can do is flee the country and hope one day, Venezuela will return to its roots."
twrvenezuela.1.a:0 "Our rule has come to an end. It was good while it lasted."
twrvenezuela.1.b:0 "Send in the Army! Bring me the heads of the rebels on pikes!"
twrvenezuela.2.t:0 "The 1954 Elections"
twrvenezuela.2.d:0 "With dictator Perez Jimenez now long gone, it is high time for our country to elect its new ruler and finally bring democracy to Venezuela! With most of the opposition parties gone during the reign of Jimenez, only four were able to participate, the URD, the AD, the COPEI and the IPFM. \n\nNow its up to the people's vote to decide what direction Venezuela will take with its future!"
twrvenezuela.2.a:0 "Wolfgang Larrazabal for a state led by the people, for the people!"
twrvenezuela.2.b:0 "Romulo Bello will lead our nation with a moderate hand away from extremists!"
twrvenezuela.2.c:0 "Rafael Caldera will create a state that cares for all and its neighbours!"
twrvenezuela.2.e:0 "Arturo Pietri will make us into the market center of South America!"
twrvenezuela.3.t:0 "MAN Attempt Coup"
twrvenezuela.3.d:0 "Its only been a few days since the socialist government of Wolfgang Larrazabal was elected when brigades of armed men in grey shirts began to march into the capital. Since the fall of Jinemez, German Borregales, the leader of  the Movimiento de Accion Nacional, has been gathering support among the population of Venezuela, with his anti-communist policies being popular among the conservative and religious citizens of Venezuela. \n\nNow firefights have begun in our capital and even President Wolfgang is preparing to take up arms to defend the capital. Will the army hold or have the anti-communist ideas of Borregales infected the loyal men of Wolfgang?"
twrvenezuela.3.a:0 "Venceremos! Noone shall ever threaten Venezuela's democracy!"
twrvenezuela.3.b:0 "Viva Venezuela! Death to the Bolsheviks who have invaded our Motherland!"
##World Events##
twrvenezuela.4.t:0 "Borregales's Anti-Communist Coup"
twrvenezuela.4.d:0 "Ever since Wolfgang took office many people had sought to undermine him, probably none more thanGerman Borregales, the leader of the Movimiento de Acción Nacional. MAN promotes an anti-communist and pro-catholic, which has given him much support among the conservatives of Venezuela. Now he has his chance to overthrow the government and has stormed the capital with his men and, after a brutal fight with the army in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, Borregales removed Wolfgang, placing himself as the new ruler of Venezuela and shall now lead the troubled nation into the future against bolshevism."
twrvenezuela.4.a:0 "Communism is put out for the day..."
twrvenezuela.5.t:0 "Borregales's Coup Fails"
twrvenezuela.5.d:0 "It appears that a coup attempt against newly-inaugurated president Wolfgang Larrazábal in the South American nation of Venezuela has been foiled, as the would-be coupists, led by Germán Borregales, head of the National Action Movement, failed to enter the Miraflores Palace. \n\nThe plotters were arrested tonight, and, when asked by journalists as he was being arrested, Borregales stated that he was acting against President Larrazábal, who he called a communist."
twrvenezuela.5.a:0 "A close call for Venezuela."
twrvenezuela.6.t:0 "Wolfgang Wins Election"
twrvenezuela.6.d:0 "This morning the results of the election came in. With a stunning lead Wolgang Larrazabal has been elected the first president of the Venezuelan republic. Running under the socilalist Union Republicana Democratica party, he ran under the slogan of "a government for the people, by the people". Now having been elected president, he promises to pass many reforms to help the state flourish. With Wolfgang in charge, Venezuela will become the new beacon of equality and will flourish under the flames of revolution."
twrvenezuela.6.a:0 "The people have spoken."
twrvenezuela.7.t:0 "Romulo Wins Election"
twrvenezuela.7.d:0 "This morning the election results came in and it was announced that Romulo Betancourt has been elected president of the Venezuelan republic. Romulo ran under the conservative independientes pro-frente nacional party promising to sway Venezuela away from extremists and to crack down on revolutionary paramilitaries. It is no secret, however, that he is supported by the Americans and will try to make Venezuela have closer bonds to the US. Nevertheless, he has been elected Venezuela's president and now has the task of leading the country into the future as a proud democracy."
twrvenezuela.7.a:0 "Democracy grows inch by inch."
twrvenezuela.8.t:0 "Rafael Wins Election"
twrvenezuela.8.d:0 "With the election results finally coming in it has been announced that Rafael Caldera under the social-democratic Accion Democratica party has been elected the new president of Venezuela. Rafael ran  under a campaign of more education reforms, protecting catholic institutions, a policy which has resonated with the catholic majority of Venezuela, and seeking greater economic cooperation among the other Latin American nations. With him being elected, he will bring Venezuela into prosperity and a state of renewed democracy."
twrvenezuela.8.a:0 "A better Venezuela for Venezuelans."
twrvenezuela.9.t:0 "Arturo Wins Election"
twrvenezuela.9.d:0 "The results of the election have come in and it has been announced that Arturo Pietri is the first president of the new Venezuelan republic. Arturo ran under the liberal Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente party promising to boost the Venezuelan economy and promote what he calls “conservative bolivarianism”. He is also very pro-American, wanting to expand economic ties with them and ban pro-German organizations in the country. Arturo will lead a new Venezuela out of the rubble of the old and broken."
twrvenezuela.9.a:0 "Freer the markets, the freer the people."
twrvenezuela.10.t:0 "Democratic Coup Succeeds"
twrvenezuela.10.d:0 "Today armed mobs had gathered around the capital protesting for freedom. This protest soon turned into an open revolt with the people demanding that Generalissimo Perez Jimenez allow democratic elections in Venezuela. After getting news of his refusal, a military officer named Wolfgang Larrazabal led a group of disgruntled soldiers to storm the presidential palace. As they walked through the streets, many civilian protesters joined the soldiers. Jimenez getting word of this quickly fled the country allowing Wolfgang to enter the presidential office unopposed. Now at the head of the government, Wolfgang promises to prepare for new elections to decide the new president of Venezuela."
twrvenezuela.10.a:0 "Venezuela is in a new age."
twrvenezuela.11.t:0 "Democratic Coup Fails"
twrvenezuela.11.d:0 "Today many citizens had flocked to the streets protesting the actions of the Perez Jimenez government. These protesters had demanded that the general reform the government and hold free, democratic elections. Getting word of these demands, Perez Jiminez gave the soldiers holding back the protesters the order to use lethal force. With this, the soldiers started firing into the angry crowds, quickly dispersing them. This news has come as a shock to many people within the country, unable to believe their leader had just killed innocent civilians. Now Perez Jimenez has secured his rightful place as dictator of Venezuela and will no doubt be vengeful against these so called "revolutionaries"."
twrvenezuela.11.a:0 "The Caudillo's reign has just begun."
