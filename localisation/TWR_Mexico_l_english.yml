twrMexico.1.t:0 "The Elections of 1952"
twrMexico.1.d:0 "The elections are here! Across all of Mexico, voters flock to the polls, eager to cast their vote for their preferred candidate. Our polling stations have been pushed to their brink as crowds of eager voters push to the ballots. The three parties now wait anxiously for their results.\n\nThe PRI, the current incumbents and front-runners, are led into 1952 by Adolfo Ruiz Cortines. Espousing a highly domestic, independent policy of infrastructural advancements, nuclear energy, and strict neutrality on the world stage, Cortines' policies have caught on with the Mexican populace. With a sizeable lead in the polls coming into the election, Cortines is widely expected to take the election and keep the PRI in office.\n\nThe PRI's primary contender, the PAN, is led by the conservative catholic Efraín González Luna. Luna has captured much of the conservative vote, preaching to fiery crowds about the dangers of socialism and pushing a fiercely pro-American foreign policy, up to joining the Toronto Accord. Domestically, his policy heavily endorses small government and free trade. While most do still think Cortines's lead is too much for Luna to overcome, there is no denying that he has whipped the right into a frenzy. Perhaps this can carry him to the President's office.\n\nFinally, the Marxist PPS, led by Vincente Lombardo Toledano, is regarded by all but the most heavily skewed polls as a distant third in the election. This has not slowed or discouraged Toledano, who speaks to large gatherings of both the workers and the long-oppressed native groups of Mexico about the danger of unchecked capitalism and authoritarianism. With his aggressively interventionist rhetoric against dictatorships such as those in Dominica, along with his promise to nationalize the economy, most official pollsters have dismissed Toledano as too radical for Mexico. However, those who look deeper can see the motivation that his promises of increased liberty and representation have put into the natives and workers. Perhaps there is more to the PPS than what is expected?"
twrMexico.1.a:0 "The PRI. A moderate hand prevails!"
twrMexico.1.b:0 "The PAN. Conservatism rises!"
twrMexico.1.c:0 "The PPS. The people have spoken!"
twrMexico.2.t:0 "Mexico Wants In"
twrMexico.2.d:0 "The White House received an unusual request today. The pro-American government of Mexico, led by Efraín González Luna, has sent a request to be formally admitted into the Toronto Accord. This has been a promise of Luna's since the beginning of his campaign, and comes as no surprise to any official who has paid any attention to Mexican politics in the last few years. However, as obvious as the answer may seem on the surface, there have been multiple arguments made against accepting the Mexicans into the Accord.\n\nThe Pro-Mexican camp, led by most of the Joint Command, has been lobbying fiercely for accepting Mexico. Their arguments hinge on multiple reasons, such as strength in numbers and the increased resources a friendly Mexico would bring our alliance against the Nazi menace. Their main argument, however, says that a Mexico in the Accord would give us increased influence across all of Latin America, acting as a base of operations for any actions we would wish to take against Nazi influence in both Central and South America. Besides, their admission to the Accord may prompt others to think about joining us as well.\n\nHowever, an Anti-Mexican camp has sprung up, cautioning the President against acceptance. Their arguments revolve around the cost vs. benefit of accepting Mexico, due to the obligations we would then be forced to give to the Mexican government. Besides that, however, their main argument says that adding MExico to the Accord will only drag us into conflict after conflict in Latin America, since Luna's fiercely anti-socialist rhetoric has the potential to spring into military action. Under the Accord, any conflict that Mexico would get into would inevitably lead to our involvement, as according to the treaty.\n\nBoth camps have made their arguments, and the decision now falls to the President. This choice may affect the balance of power in Latin America for decades to come, and its importance can not be understated."
twrMexico.2.a:0 "The more the merrier!"
twrMexico.2.b:0 "We cannot plunge into Latin America so brazenly."
twrMexico.3.t:0 "America Says Yes!"
twrMexico.3.d:0 "After a tense, short wait, the response we were hoping for has arrived. America has allowed us into the Toronto Accord. Currently, the media is hailing this as a great victory for the PAN, and multiple celebrations have already broken out with Mexican and American flags waving chaotically through the air. The Mexican Army and the government now prepares itself to accept the responsibilities and obligations required of it. A bright future seems to lie ahead for Mexico, and the question now becomes- \"How do we seize it to its greatest extent?\""
twrMexico.3.a:0 "Cheers!"
twrMexico.4.t:0 "America Declines"
twrMexico.4.d:0 "After a tense, short wait, the unexpected has occurred- America has taken a look at our offer to join them and refused! Disbelief sweeps the capital and fans out into the countryside, as the government scrambles to deal with this frank rebuttal of a pillar of their foreign policy. Already, protests and anti-american marches have sprung up across Mexico, as our relations with them take a suddenly sour turn. It's unclear why we were rejected, but Luna has already promised to make the Americans regret their rash choice, whatever the reasoning behind it may have been."
twrMexico.4.a:0 "We'll show them!"
twrMexico.5.t:0 "The Ejército de Liberación Indígena"
twrMexico.5.d:0 "Behind what modern infrastructure Mexico has been able to prop up in recent years lies a network of dirt roads and mountain trails linking the people of the nation together like a thousand arteries leading all the way to the heart: Mexico City. The blood pumps slowly though, and before the government can take action chances are the news will reach people first. So it was with the recent moves by the conservative Mexican government to restrict the meager rights of the Indigenous Mexicans. \n\nBefore the ink of the new legislation could even dry the myriad native peoples were preparing for action. Labelled \"pagan savages\" by even the moderates in the new government and now threatened with new forms of discrimination as modernisation begins to sweep through the country and with it a rising tide of reactionary ideals, many pieces begin to shift. Some up north prepared to simply move to quieter areas or weather the storm as their ancestors had done for centuries. In the south however, in the creeping jungles of Chiapas, there is thunder. \n\nInspired by the legacies of Emiliano Zapata and the Yucatan Republic it seems that the recent laws have proven too much for the Maya to tolerate. Taking to the streets in droves and flooding southern cities from the countryside, police stations and small army barracks fall swiftly as riots spark and communities begin to bind together across regional and ethnic lines. \n\nThis new 'Ejército de Liberación Indígena', Army of Indigenous Liberation, seeks to reclaim not only those recently lost rights but over four centuries of blood and loss. Whether this loose military confederacy will be able to withstand a Mexican counterattack will be seen shortly, but until then it seems the United States of Mexico may not be united for very long."
twrMexico.5.a:0 "Kill those damned Pagans!"
twrMexico.6.t:0 "The ELI has been crushed!"
twrMexico.6.d:0 "One last shot is fired in the outskirts of Tuxtla Gutiérrez before the soldiers of the Ejército Mexicano decide to lower their weapons. The city is worse for wear than it was before the army arrives, a few slums crushed beneath requisitioned vehicles and the odd building ablaze after a firefight. But with that last shot the fighting is done; Mexico is whole again. \n\nUndoubtedly the ELI remnants will regroup and continue a subtler campaign. Already from the rooftops victorious soldiers can see militiamen and native sympathisers limp through the underbrush and into the greater forests surrounding them. They will likely camp out in the mountains until their morale is broken, but for now that is not a problem. Now is the time for celebration. \n\nWithin hours news reaches the capital, passing through military bases and garrisons on the way to its target. Each time it does the soldiers cheer and drink a toast to their victory. When it reaches President Guzmán's ears the sentiment is shared, and he smiles knowing his nation is secured and safe. \n\nTomorrow Mexico buries her noble dead. Tonight however, she drinks a toast! To the truly United States of Mexico!"
twrMexico.6.a:0 "Noone attacks the Mexican State and lives..."
twrMexico.7.t:0 "The Autonomous Indigenous Republics    "
twrMexico.7.d:0 "As the ELI breaks through the gates of the National Palace palpable tension pulses through the streets. Indigenous militiamen surround it from the outside, as they have begun to do for all of the newly captured capital city, and they wait. Nervous fingers twitch near triggers. Nervous eyes scan each passerby. Nervous murmurs are heard from militia and civilian both as all wait in fear of what comes next. \n\nAfter an agonising hour, President Guzmán and his cabinet leave the fortified building and agree to parley. Through the palace gates, riding on a horse, comes one 'Comandante Elias'. The enigmatic general goes alongside other military official to represent the United Indigenous Council on the terms of armistice. \n\nWith his hands in front of him and a gun at his back Guzmán is lead to the Plaza de la Constitución to make the signing public. A table is set up for all the city to see, and crowds gather as a long list of demands is unfurled. A legal end to racial discrimination, the establishment of protections of indiginous peoles and their land, and most eggregiously of all the formal succession of land south of Veracruz to the Guatemalan border in the creation of a new Union of Autonomous Indigenous Republics. \n\nAs Mexican tricolor is lowered, the black ELI flag is raised on a mast above the Plaza and the President bows his head. Pen in hand he signs the document. Seeing their leader finally give in, his cabinet does the same and grants their reluctant assent to the Indigenous demands. \n\nThe people of Mexico City don't celebrate this. Even as the document is rolled up and taken by the Comandante not even the Indigenous soldiers break the deafening silence. Led by Comandante Elias the troops withdraw from the city, peace assured, and prepare to return to a new home. The last soldier to go pushes a tattered Mexican flag into the dour President's hands, and leaves. \n\nWere it not for the burning buildings one would think they were never even there."
twrMexico.7.a:0 "Peaceful defeat than more bloodshed..."
twrMexico.8.t:0 "To Intervene or Not to Intervene"
twrMexico.8.d:0 "We in Mexico have successfully established a people's democracy in our country, but that does not mean that our neighbours have been as lucky. All across Central America and the Caribbean, tyrants keep the livelihood of the people under their jagged and heavy boots, and all of it happens in the depths of our shadows. In his capacity as foreign minister, president Toledano has presented two distinct foreign policy plans to the National Assembly on the question of democracy amongst our closest neighbours. \n\nHis first plan, dubbed the roses method by observers, calls for the Mexican state to provide material support for existing democracies in the region, such as the regime in Guatemala. The roses method would see us sign defense treaties and guarantees of independence with these democracies, as well as provide joint military exercises and developmental assistance. The plan is broadly supported among the PPS moderates, but some of the party's hardliners argue that it lets the likes of Trujillo fester in the dark, away from the light of our torch. \n\nHis second plan, dubbed the poison ivy method, seems to be Toledano's answer for the hawks within the PPS. The plan calls for Mexico to officially denounce the regimes in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua as threats to the safety of all Central America. Mexico would also provide arms support for the socialist and democratic revolutionaries in those countries, expel their ambassadors in Mexico City, and petition the Toronto Accord powers to enact a trade embargo on them. The plan placates the hardline sentiments within the party, but many moderates suggest that the plan goes against the principles which the PPS was founded on, and that these aggressive efforts might backfire on us. \n\nIt is now time for the Assembly to vote on one plan or the other. Will we keep the small flames around us lit forevermore, or will we try to shine a light on the darkness?"
twrMexico.8.a:0 "Go with roses!"
twrMexico.8.b:0 "Go with ivy!"
twrMexico.9.t:0 "Leftist Revolutionaries seize Santo Domingo!"
twrMexico.9.d:0 "The worst fears of our high command have been realized tonight. At around 2 in the morning, shots were heard in various neighbourhoods around the presidential place, and after some small fire-fights, local police garrisons were to identify the shooters as the Revolutionary Social Democratic Party, with accomplices from both the Socialist and Communist parties. Despite being banned by direct order of Generalissimo Trujillo, the RSDP has continued to organize and operate underground, gathering arms from several foreign sympathizers. We suspect that this attack was sponsored, at least in part, by the Mexican Socialist Party. \n\nAs most of the main Santo Domingo garrison was sent into the countryside for routine training exercises, the revolutionaries have faced little resistance in their campaign across the capital. In the streets, cries proclaiming the "People's republic of Dominica" or the "Santo Domingo Soviet" can be heard. The leftists control all of the major police stations, the airport, the rail communications and the port. The revolutionaries will surely converge on the presidential place itself soon, and unless reinforcements arrive in time, Trujillo will be captured and our government will fall. God only what is to happen after that."
twrMexico.9.a:0 "The socialist revolutionaries breach the presidential palace and capture the Trujillo government."
twrMexico.9.b:0 "The Santo Domingo garrison mobilizes and beats back the leftist insurrection."
twrMexico.10.t:0 "Coup Successful!"
twrMexico.10.d:0 "The democratic and revolutionary forces we helped arm aboard have found success in overthrowing their national oppressors. We are already establishing relations and communications with the new revolutionary governments."
twrMexico.10.a:0 "Another dictator toppled!"
twrMexico.11.t:0 "Coup Failed!"
twrMexico.11.d:0 "The forces we helped arm aboard were not able to overthrow their tyrannical government, and the old order persists. Many of the revolutionaries have seeked asylum and safety in Mexico."
twrMexico.11.a:0 "The people will suffer under his iron fist..."
twrMexico.12.t:0 "The Million Soul March"
twrMexico.12.d:0 "For the past week, Managua has been frozen still by widespread protests and strikes. Led by the democratic Independent Liberal Party, many of the capital's citizens have stopped going to their places of work or schooling, paying taxes, and are blocking the major roads in and out of the city. These strike efforts have been reflected across Nicaragua, and they are all united under a common goal, outsing the Somoza government. \n\nProtestors have been camped outside of the national congress and the presidential palace for days now. Although this is not an armed insurrection, the country cannot handle this amount of stoppage, and the Somozas certainly cannot handle their family-owned enterprises from faltering or losing profit. Something must be done about this, and it must be done with haste. \n\nAnastasio Somoza Garcia solemnly sits in his office, overlooking the innumerable mass of people that are occupying the square outside the palace, and he is faced with two options. He can accept the people's demands and resign in disgrace, allowing a new government to form in Managua, or he can call the generals, and order them to put down the strikers by whatever means necessary. \n\nThe future of Nicaragua depends on this moment."
twrMexico.12.a:0 "Let the people in through the gates and resign"
twrMexico.12.b:0 "To hell with these troublemakers! Make the army send them back to work!"
twrMexico.13.t:0 "Coup Successful!"
twrMexico.13.d:0 "The democratic and revolutionary forces we helped arm aboard have found success in overthrowing their national oppressors. We are already establishing relations and communications with the new revolutionary governments."
twrMexico.13.a:0 "Another dictator toppled!"
twrMexico.14.t:0 "Coup Failed!"
twrMexico.14.d:0 "The forces we helped arm aboard were not able to overthrow their tyrannical government, and the old order persists. Many of the revolutionaries have seeked asylum and safety in Mexico."
twrMexico.14.a:0 "Damn that Nicaraguan fatman!"
twrMexico.15.t:0 "A Portrait of Frida Kahlo"
twrMexico.15.d:0 "On the 13th July 1954, Mexican artistic icon Frida Kahlo has breathed her last. Plagued with polio since childhood, and now bedridden with pneumonia, the figure of modern surrealist art has passed. Whether from the illness, the fever or an overdose on painkillers is still unknown, and may never be known as her husband Diego Rivera plans to cremate her as she wished. \n\nThat evening her coffin is lead to the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. Laid in state and shrouded by a crimson communist flag, friends and family look on as outside hundreds of admirers mourn the loss of a great figure. \n\nLiberals call her a radical artiste, conservatives view her as a delusional radical out of touch with reality, and socialists declare her an inspiration taken too soon from this cruel world. \n\nYet despite it all she was, and will always remain, Frida Kahlo."
twrMexico.15.a:0 "May she rest in peace"
twrMexico.15.b:0 "Took her long enough..."
twrMexico.16.t:0 "A Mural of Frida Kahlo"
twrMexico.16.d:0 "On the 13th July 1954, Mexican artistic icon Frida Kahlo has breathed her last. Plagued with polio since childhood, and now bedridden with pneumonia, the figure of modern surrealist art has passed. Whether from the illness, the fever or an overdose on painkillers is still unknown, and may never be known as her husband Diego Rivera plans to cremate her as she wished. \n\nPresident Toledano, upon hearing of her death, declares a national day of mourning and personally arranges events with Rivera and Kahlo's family. \n\nTraffic through the city is stopped as a grand parade is arranged in the city. Red banners adorn the streets besides grand Mexican tricolors and her coffin is marched down from her home all through the winding roads into the Plaza de la Constitución. As the casket arrives the crowd cheers and cries in mourning and celebration of Kahlo's memory. Toledano stands before the crowd and speaks at length of the late artist's contributions not only to Mexico's cultural heart but to the international socialist movement as a whole. It is then he declares that his government has convened to grant in post mortem the National Prize for Arts and Sciences for the Fine Arts to Frida Kahlo, as a small way to repay the gifts she had blessed the Mexican people with in life. \n\nThe crowd cheers in an uproar and as the president returns to be seated, others read their eulogies. Each speaker lays a rose at her grave, and soon hundreds pour from the crowd to add to the growing bouquet honouring the lost artist. \n\nThat evening her coffin is lead to the National Palace. Laid in state and shrouded by a crimson communist flag, friends and family look on as outside thousands of admirers begin to chant and commemorate. As the sun sets plans are already underway to erect a statue of her before the Palacio de Bellas Artes, to cement her legacy for a generation. \n\nShe was a revolutionary thinker, a doer of what some would call impossible, and a wondrous mind which brought so much to a world which gave her so little. Yet despite it all she was, and will always remain, Frida Kahlo."
twrMexico.16.a:0 "May she inspire us for a century to come..."
twrMexico.101.t:0 "PRI Elected"
twrMexico.101.d:0 "As the polls close in Mexico, it is becoming clear that the PRI, or Partido Revolucionario Institucional, has won the latest electoral race in the country. Largest seen as Mexico's "natural" party, the PRI have promised the Mexican people a strong and stable status quo in the face of German-dominated world. Adolfo Ruiz, the new president of Mexico, promises a policy of insular development and soft power in Latin America."
twrMexico.101.a:0 "Let's see how this goes for Mexico"
twrMexico.102.t:0 "PAN Elected"
twrMexico.102.d:0 "As the last Mexican polling stations begin to report their numbers, the latest electoral race seems to have been won by the PAN, or the Partido Acción Nacional. Long established as the conservative opposition to the generally liberal and social democratic PRI party, the PAN have historically struggled to gain political prominence in Mexico, but those days seem to be over now. Running on a platform of small government, privatisation, and catholic values, the PAN have won over the Mexican voter."
twrMexico.102.a:0 "Let's see how this goes for Mexico"
twrMexico.103.t:0 "PPS Elected"
twrMexico.103.d:0 "Having shocked essentially the entire world, the PPS, or the Mexican Socialist Party have won in the most recent electoral race. The party stands in stark opposition to both the PRI and PAN parties of mainstream Mexican politics, and its victory is being largely attributed to anti-American sentiment and anger at the perceived sluggishness of the Mexican political establishment. Only time will tell if the party can do good on its promise to bring socialism to Mexico."
twrMexico.103.a:0 "A Socialist Mexico? Who could conceive of such a thing!"
