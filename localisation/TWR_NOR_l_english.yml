 ##Focus
 NOR_Question_of_the_Quisling_Regime:0 "Question of the Quisling Regime"
 NOR_Question_of_the_Quisling_Regime_desc:0 "Norway is at a crossroads. With a cautious political thaw underway, there's a sense across this nation that a great change is at hand. Even though the Reich is easing its control, Quisling remains direly unpopular. Although he has ambitions to create a strong, independent Norway under his control, others in this country and even his government may have different plans in mind."
 NOR_Terboven_Recalled:0 "Terboven Recalled"
 NOR_Terboven_Recalled_desc:0 "At long last, the hated Reichkommisar Josef Terboven has been recalled to Germania. He's the one person in Norway who may be more maligned than Quisling, so his departure is a welcome one. This will be a major step towards making Norway independent once more, but certain challenges are already arising within the party now that Germania is no longer calling the shots..."
 NOR_1952_Party_Crisis:0 "1952 Party Crisis"
 NOR_1952_Party_Crisis_desc:0 "The Nasjonal Samling will be navigating the troubled waters ahead on its own without much German oversight. It's no secret to Quisling or any of his associates that his regime is despised by the general public. Even within the NS his standing is precarious, meaning we have to move quickly if we're to weather the coming storm."
 NOR_Summon_the_Congress:0 "Summon the Congress"
 NOR_Summon_the_Congress_desc:0 "We have to summon the upper echelons of the party to Oslo at once. There's a non-negligible chance that the Samling will fall apart at the seams during the planned congress. Unless we're able to work out some sort of arrangement with Lie and Saether, Quisling will be in even more dire straits than he already is."
 NOR_Quislings_Leadership:0 "Quisling's Leadership"
 NOR_Quislings_Leadership_desc:0 "We have emerged from the flames with renewed resolve. Quisling has made it this far and for the time being he will hold strong."
 NOR_Purge_of_Unloyal_Elements:0 "Purge of Unloyal Elements"
 NOR_Purge_of_Unloyal_Elements_desc:0 "Quisling isn't a dumb guy. He knows that he's not well-liked by certain people within the party. Orders have come down from him to root out all disloyal elements at once."
 NOR_A_Deal_with_Hitler:0 "A Deal with Hitler"
 NOR_A_Deal_with_Hitler_desc:0 "Hitler has been exceedingly generous in his dealings with us. For now we'll play it safe. It's in our best interest to stay in Germania's good graces. Allowing the Kriegsmarine to continue using our naval bases is a small price to pay for an independent Norway."
 NOR_Take_a_Hard_Stance:0 "Take a Hard Stance"
 NOR_Take_a_Hard_Stance_desc:0 "We have been too easy-going. Hitler doesn't deserve anymore of our courtesy. We will harden our hearts and so shall the people of Norway. The push for independence will be painful but it is the only way to free our proud nation."
 NOR_A_Norwegian_Government:0 "A Norwegian Government"

 NOR_Assert_Norwegian_Independence:0 "Assert Norwegian Independence"
 NOR_Assert_Norwegian_Independence_desc:0 "Despite all the sacrifices we've made for the Norwegian people, our government has undeservedly gotten a bad reputation both at home and abroad. For some reason we're perceived as \"Renfields\" for the Reich. We can project an image of legitimacy if we make it clearer that we are no man's puppets."
 NOR_Disband_the_GSSN:0 "Disband the GSSN"
 NOR_Disband_the_GSSN_desc:0 "The GSSN's ties to the mainland SS are an active threat to Norway's stability and sovereignty. It's no secret that Jonas Lie and Quisling have never liked each other, not the least of which because Lie was appointed at Terboven's request. There's a real possibility that he and his depraved SS goons will strike again sooner rather than later. The organization needs to be dissolved as soon as possible."
 NOR_Expand_the_Statspolitiet:0 "Expand the Statspolitiet"
 NOR_Expand_the_Statspolitiet_desc:0 "We should transfer the GSSN's policing duties to the Statspolitiet. Now that Lie is out of the picture, it stands to reason that this other organization will have to pick up the slack. As long as we provide them with increased funding and recruit more STAPO agents, Norway will be safe from Zionist mental derangement in all its forms."

 NOR_Renew_Our_Territorial_Claims:0 "Renew Our Territorial Claims"
 NOR_Renew_Our_Territorial_Claims_desc:0 "For a time, Norway was one of the premier powers of northern europe.

The day is coming soon when our banner will fly over Sweden's Norwegian provinces, the Kola peninsula, the Faroes, the Hebrides, and Iceland once more!"
 NOR_Declare_Norwegian_First:0 "Declare Norwegian First"
 NOR_Declare_Norwegian_First_desc:0 "The interests of the Norwegian master race must come before all else. Our living space needs to be expanded on if we are to realize our full potential. The whole of the North Sea is rightfully Norwegian."
 NOR_The_New_Norwegian_Nation:0 "The New Norwegian Nation"
 NOR_The_New_Norwegian_Nation_desc:0 "From here on out, Norway will no longer be thought of as client state of the Reich.

The day will soon come when his name is evoked as one of the greatest leaders in Norwegian history."
 NOR_A_Norwegian_Army:0 "A Norwegian Army"
 NOR_A_Norwegian_Army_desc:0 "Norwegian sovereignty can only be upheld through force of arms. We should expand the Hirden so that we'll be ready to defend our shores should the Reich and the Toronto Accord come looking for trouble. If we model our fighting forces off the Heer, we'll have the best possible soldiers this side of the peninsula."
 NOR_Quisling_Neutrality:0 "Quisling Neutrality"
 NOR_Quisling_Neutrality_desc:0 "Now that we're independent, we need to start acting like it. The war on the continent is none of our business. It would be in our best interest to stay out of such trifles. Norway can and should strive to avoid getting entangled in the Reich's turmoil."
 NOR_Nasjonal_Samling_Crumbled:0 "Nasjonal Samling Crumbled"
 NOR_Nasjonal_Samling_Crumbled_desc:0 "The congress was nothing short of a catastrophe. Neither Quisling or Lie was able to attain a decisive advantage over the other. Now the party is in shambles and Norway lacks a leader. Something must be done at once if we're to prevent the resistance or the Toronto Accord from striking."
 NOR_Return_of_Terboven:0 "Return of Terboven"
 NOR_Return_of_Terboven_desc:0 "Due to the NS's inability to resolve its internal difficulties, Josef Terboven will return to restore order to the wayward RK. Although he's not particularly well-liked there, he's the only person we can rely on right now who can set things right."
 NOR_Reinforce_the_Reichskommissariat:0 "Reinforce the Reichskommissariat"
 NOR_Reinforce_the_Reichskommissariat_desc:0 "Norway's drift towards independence has sent the country into a downward spiral. We cannot loosen our grip if this is what the natives get up to when they're granted the slightest bit of autonomy. Norway is a colony of the Reich, first and foremost. It requires Germania's guidance."
 NOR_Project_Nordstern:0 "Project Nordstern"
 NOR_Project_Nordstern_desc:0 "Norway will be redesigned from the ground up as a model colony of the Reich. Every facet of the economy will be geared towards what it can export to the mainland."
 NOR_Focus_on_Fishing:0 "Focus on Fishing"
 NOR_Focus_on_Fishing_desc:0 "If Norway is to be a productive colony of the Reich, it needs to start turning a profit. Norway's lucrative fishing industry should be expanded on. The country can offer the Reich a lot more than merely hosting its war fleets."
 NOR_Declare_Our_Neutrality:0 "Declare Our Neutrality"
 NOR_Declare_Our_Neutrality_desc:0 "Norway needs to stay away from the rumble on the continent. Our boys are going to sit this one out. We'll try to get into the good graces of whoever emerges as the victor."
 NOR_Ending_the_Crisis:0 "Ending the Crisis"

 NOR_Hirden_Coup:0 "Hirden's Coup"
 NOR_Hirden_Coup_desc:0 "The party apparatus has failed Norway. Their incessant bickering has left our proud nation rudderless in stormy waters while the German kraken draws near. It's time for the stormtroopers to step in and restore order."
 NOR_Norwegian_Junta:0 "Norwegian Junta"
 NOR_Norwegian_Junta_desc:0 "This country lacks the stabilizing influence of a military man's guidance. This is how we'll restore Norway's integrity. The Hirden's discipline will give this country the sense of direction it badly needs."

 NOR_Militarize_the_Nation:0 "Militarize the Nation"
 NOR_Militarize_the_Nation_desc:0 "Norway has to be strong if it's going to survive the perils of the post-war era. An ambitious expansion of the Hirden is needed at once if it is to become the basis for a new Norwegian military. We will draw up plans to found a Hirden navy and luftwaffe at once. We'll also institute an ambitious recruitment drive by making service compulsory for all able-bodied men both within and outside of the party."
 NOR_Indepedence_Through_Might:0 "Indepedence Through Might"
 NOR_Indepedence_Through_Might_desc:0 "With the Hirden reforms under way, Norway is marching towards a better future. While we can never match their full military might, we'll be able to better defend ourselves against the meddling of both the Reich and the Toronto Accord. Norway's place in the sun will be secured through the barrel of a gun."
 NOR_Lies_Coup:0 "Lie's Coup"

 NOR_Purge_the_Quisling_Faction_desc:0 "Quisling lacks the constitution to do what needs to be done. He's not well-equipped to lead Norway at this critical juncture. Anyone who thought he was needs to be dealt with, forcefully if necessary."
 NOR_Pan_Germanic_Government:0 "Pan-Germanic Government"

 NOR_The_Norwegian_Enlightenment:0 "The Norwegian Enlightenment"
 NOR_The_Norwegian_Enlightenment_desc:0 "Christianity is a vestige of Norway's shameful past, one that we ought to move away from. We will offer \"Positive Christianity\" as a legal alternative for anyone who doesn't forsake the cross, but Norway will no longer be a Christian state. The dechristianization process will continue whether they want it to or not."
 NOR_Expand_the_GSSN:0 "Expand the GSSN"
 NOR_Expand_the_GSSN_desc:0 "The GSSN is set to become the de facto police and military force of Norway.

 NOR_Establish_New_Legions:0 "Establish New Legions"

 twrnorway.1.t:0 "The Nordic Guard"
 twrnorway.1.d:0 "On June 10, 1940. The Norwegian Government capitulated to the Reich, the King and Government fled into exile on the British Isles. Almost immediately the SS began to round up Norway's small minority of Jewish Citizens. As the Germans solidified their dominated over the South, several Norwegian Divisions still loyal to the old Government and refused to surrender began to engage German Divisions using Guerilla tactics in a desperate attempt to recapture the strategic port of Trondheim. Their attempts failed and most of these rogue divisions surrendered soon following the attempted capture of Trondheim.\n\nJosef Terboven was selected to be Reichskommissar for the Occupied Norwegian Territories. For two years he ruled with an Iron Fist! Stamping out all political opposition and establishing full-German Dominance across the nation. Following several uprisings Berlin decided that they should appoint a Norwegian loyal to their cause to lead this new nation while also keeping Terboven in the picture. Prominent Norwegian collaborator, Vidkun Quisling was chosen to head a new State. Though Quisling is unpopular and is widely viewed as a German-Puppet, having a Norwegian as the leader of the newly established Nazi-Norwegian State helped the Germans stabilize the region.\n\nBy 1952, the German Kriegsmarine uses Norwegian Ports as a jumping off point for access to the Atlantic, several German Ships are stationed in Norway. The Germans are also continuing to exploit Norwegian Natural-Resources. The average Norwegian enjoys a relatively good life, though some continue to resist the Quisling Government. Small groups of bandits are engaging in strikes on German Supply Convoys in the North of the nation. Meanwhile, the Nasjonal Samling is facing one of it's biggest crisis since the end of the German-Norwegian War, with Quisling's faction attempting to create an independent Norway, while factions within the government are torn on Norway's policies. Will Norway survive? Or will it fall?"
 twrnorway.1.a:0 "Heil og Sæl!"
 twrnorway.2.t:0 "The Narvik Incident"
 twrnorway.2.d:0 "Yesterday, when the Norwegian Gestapo responded to a report of resistance activities. However, the Gestapo failed to identify the supposedly suspect, but the local Director's order on "success at all cost" resulted in the Gestapo agents using extreme tactics.\n\nThose agents entered a local hospital, attempting to use hostages to lure out the supposed rebel. When police officers responded to the situtation, they were turned away by the Gestapo agents, and the hostage situation escalated into systematic executions of hospital workers and patients. 54 Norwegians died to the Gestapo Operation, and it only ended when the director recalled the agents. Originally, the GSSN and Gestapo attempted to suppress information surrounding this incident, but the mere scale of this event meant it was impossible to contain.\n\n News of this tragedy shocked Norway, rumours are spreading, saying that the Quisling Regime and Nasjonal Samling did nothing to save their fellow Norwegians, and both the government and party are just glorified Nazi puppets."

 twrnorway.3.d:0 "Not forgetting the Gestapo's terrible crimes, the people of Norway have launched demonstrations and strikes throughout different parts of Norway. In cities such as Oslo, the protestors' numbers were in the thousands, but they were met by machine gun fire from the German Garrisons. However, in Narvik, reports about police officers refusing to take action against protestors surfaced, and the German reinforcements sent to Narvik were met with passive resistance, trains were stopped and shops refused to do businesses with German soldiers. \n\nAn emergency meeting of the Nasjonal Samling was called, and it seems that Vidkun Quisling himself is doubting the Germans' actions. Multiple ministers openly condemned the Gestapo during the party meeting, with Jonas Lie and his GSSN violently defend the Germans' actions as justified to preserve Norwegian stability."

Using Adolf Hitler's promise of Norwegian Independence from years ago as his point, he attempts to secure negotiate autonomy greater autonomy for the country. Quisling wishes that Germany recalls their Reichskommissar, and allows greater freedom for Norwegian agencies to handle its own affairs. At the same time, Quisling has promised that Norway would be grateful of Hitler's decision, and would stand with Germany until the end of time itself. \n\nThe Reich has yet to respond to our demands."

With Germany's green light, Quisling can finally focus on fixing the Party's crisis. The two factions of Pro-Germans and Anti-Germans still remain, and it's finally time to resolve this issue once and for all."
 twrnorway.42.a:0 "Ah, Progress!"
 twrnorway.43.t:0 "The Norwegian Thaw"
 twrnorway.43.d:0 "The Norwegian Dictatorship has entered uncertain times. In the wake of growing unrest and collapsing domestic support following the death of 54 Norwegians in what is known as the Narvik Incident, the Quisling Government has contacted Germania. An unprecedented telegram requesting permission to launch much-needed reforms, whose contents have been leaked to the press, has been agreed on by the German regime. As garrisons retreat from besieged domestic barracks, victorious crowds burn their German flags in the streets - celebrations are expected to continue into the next week. \n\nThe London-based Norwegian Government-in-Exile has refused to comment on this event, but as cautious assurances of support from the Toronto-aligned nations roll it, one thing is clear: the New Order faces a new threat from the man in the street."

 twrnorway.43.b:0 "All for Norway!"
 twrnorway.5.t:0 "Terboven Recalled"
 twrnorway.5.d:0 "As the Germans promised, they indeed recalled the Reichskommissar of Norway after the agreement. While Norway is still officially a Reichskommissariat, the sole head of state and lead minister is now Vidkun Quisling himself.\n\nAfter one last inspecton, Vidkun Quisling witnessed Josef Terboven's departure from Norway. Quisling promises to maintain a close relationship with Germany, just as the agreement stated."
 twrnorway.5.a:0 "Farewell, Kommissar Terboven!"
 twrnorway.6.t:0 "Nasjonal Samling Power Struggle"
 twrnorway.6.d:0 "Immediately after the departure of Josef Terboven, the Norwegian Government has entered into a messy scramble for power, with Nasjonal Samling's division turning into multiple factions. Jonas Lie, leader of the GSSN has proclaimed Quisling's reforms as "liberal" and "Bolshevik" to his colleagues. Moreover, the Hirden Chief of Staff seems to be disagreeing with Quisling's actions, hinting a possible military coup if any peaceful resolutions fail.\n\nMeanwhile, Norwegians have used this new found freedom to better organise their resistance, becoming more and more organised and gaining more influence throughout the public. Rather Quisling's actions doomed the regime or prolonged it is a matter of much debate, and only time will tell."

 twrnorway.7.t:0 "The First Norwegian Congress"
 twrnorway.7.d:0 "After the autonomy granted by the Germans, Norway can now finally form a legislative body to discuss Norway's future. But most importantly, Vidkun Quisling aims to use the First Congress debate as a tool to consolidate his power within the Nasjonal Samling and the Government. His main opponent in the congress is the radically Pro-German faction led by Jonas Lie and his GSSN, this congress will finally settle the conflict between the two, and it can only end with one side becoming the overlord of Norway itself."
 twrnorway.7.a:0 "Let the Congress begin!"
 twrnorway.8.t:0 "Norwegian Congress - German Ties"
 twrnorway.8.d:0 "The Norwegian Thaw sparked a question within the Nasjonal Samling. Nasjonal Samling has been divided in the matters of Norwegian ties with Germany, with Quisling suggesting having less ties with Germany might be the best solution to assert Norwegian indpendence. However, the group led by Jonas Lie argued that Norway must maintain close ties with Germany due to 'ancestral ties'."

 twrnorway.8.b:0 "We need less ties!"
 twrnorway.8.c:0 "No solutions were found!"
 twrnorway.9.t:0 "Norwegian Congress - Administration"
 twrnorway.9.d:0 "With the removal of the Reichskommissar, Norway's status as an independent entity was elevated. Currently, the Norwegian government is still using an old system left by the Geermans. The congress is debating on if Norway should keep its old system or draft a new, special Norwegian system."
 twrnorway.9.a:0 "Keep the German system."
 twrnorway.9.b:0 "The system needs to be reformed!"
 twrnorway.9.c:0 "The congress reaches a gridlock..."
 twrnorway.10.t:0 "Norwegian Congress - Military"
 twrnorway.10.d:0 "Under the Reichskommissar, Norway's military affairs were largely handled by the German garrisons. However, with shrinking control from Germania, many in the Nasjonal Samling are trying to reform the Hirden into a regular military force. This idea is facing heavy opposition from the GSSN, which is calling for a creation of a 'Schutzstaffel style' volunteer army."
 twrnorway.10.a:0 "Use the Schutzstaffel Style!"

 twrnorway.11.d:0 "After the meetings, the Norwegian Congress has ended. Now behind closed doors, a group of high ranking officials and party members are going to decide the party's fate. Vidkun Quisling told reporters that he is confident that the party will be united once and for all, and that the congress was a major success."
 twrnorway.11.a:0 "Finally!"
 twrnorway.12.t:0 "Lie's Coup"
 twrnorway.12.d:0 "In the dark, Vidkun Quisling was unaware that the party has been converted onto the GSSN's side. During the closed door meeting, a group of Hirden soldiers rushed in and placed Quisling under GSSN custody. After which, Jonas Lie declared himself the new leader of Norway and the Nasjonal Samling.\n\nUnder constant pressure, the rest of the Nasjonal Samling declared their loyalty for Jonas Lie, welcoming the new government with open arms."
 twrnorway.12.a:0 "GSSN is here!"
 twrnorway.13.t:0 "Quisling's Leadership Affirmed"
 twrnorway.13.d:0 "After a five hour long meeting, Vidkun Quisling's position as leader within the Nasjonal Samling was reaffirmed, and Jonas Lie's GSSN was sidelined with its political power greatly reduced.\n\nWith Quisling's leadership unquestioned, the party's internal crisis is finally over. Norway can now enact further reforms with Quisling's agenda."

 twrnorway.14.t:0 "Nasjonal Samling Collapses"
 twrnorway.14.d:0 "With a stalemate inside the congress, the final meeting ended in a total failure. Vidkun Quisling was humiliated, and his leadership is now in utter shambles.\n\nThe Nasjonal Samling has crumbled, but the Hirden will not stand idle in this political collapse."
 twrnorway.14.a:0 "Uh oh..."
 twrnorway.15.t:0 "The Hirden Coup"
 twrnorway.15.d:0 "The Hirden, paramilitary wing of the NS, has stepped in to prevent Norway from a complete political collapse. Leader of the Hirden, Ovar Saether assumed the position of Leader and made a radio speech in an attempt to calm the masses.\n\nThe whereabouts of Vidkun Quisling is unknown, and the GSSN has been completely sidelined by the Hirden Government."

 twrnorway.16.t:0 "The German-Hirden Coup"
 twrnorway.16.d:0 "The Hirden, paramilitary wing of the NS has stepped in to prevent Norway from a complete political collapse. However, the leaders of the Hirden invited Josef Terboven to return as a Reichskommissar. The Hirden argues that, due to the political failure of Norwegian politicians, requesting assistance from the German Reich is sensible and a logical conclusion."

 twrnorway.16.b:0 "A Junta, alright."
 twrnorway.17.t:0 "A Deal with the Devil"
 twrnorway.17.d:0 "Hoping for a peaceful resolution for Norway's future, Norway must strike a mutual deal to achieve national independence. However, Norway must choose one of the two approaches, she can either pay for her freedom, and offer Norwegian soldiers in Germany's time of need in exchange for independence."

The local authorities have defected to the resistance, and law enforcements are refusing to put down unrest. The Hirden has been crippled, with soldiers defecting en masse, while other agencies are failing to contain the people's outrage. \n\nThe German Garrisons were overwhelmed, and most of them surrendered, handing massive amount of equipment to the resistance. In Oslo, the seat of the government, the people have successfully overthrew the Government. Vidkun Quisling himself was captured in a local airport, right before his attempt at fleeing from Norway.\n\nThe Revolutionary Council have assumed control of the nation, and the tyrants have finally been toppled."

 twrnorway.991.d:0 "Due to the Norwegian Government's incompetence, a rebellion successfully established a Free Norway. The Norwegian Garrisons were defeated, and our vessels docked in Norway are now under rebel command.\n\nTwo factions have formed after the immediate revolt, the Pro-War faction is led by Martin Bormann and Joseph Goebbels. While they recognise Germany's current status is incapable to launch an invasion of Norway, they suggest that Norway can be used as the nation's common goal, and the war can be launched later on when Germany is finally ready for war once again. Meanwhile, the Anti-War faction led by Hermann Göring and Albert Speer argue that Germany is in no way capable of war due to its massive economic crisis and ineffective military, and to prevent Germany from over extending its forces, Norway should be ignored in favour of stronger grip on Eastern and Western Europe.\n\nNormally, Adolf Hitler would undoubtedly launch war against such crimes, this sick man's mind is simply too weak to make the decision, and considering his personal relation with some of the high-command, Hitler decides to..."

With a majority of law enforcers and soldiers defecting en masse, the German garrisons and Norwegian Government were overwhelmed. The Resistance Council has assumed temporary control for Norway, and it seems likely that they will invite the London Exiles back to Norway in the near future, including the return of Norway's rightful monarch."
