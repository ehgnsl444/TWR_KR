    twrusa.0.t:0 "The Tenth Anniversary of V-Day"
    twrusa.0.d:0 "It's been over ten years since V-Day and its echoes are still strongly felt. The post-Pacific War baby boom is still going strong although the brunt of it is over. The veterans now are getting older as their children are growing up. After the rose-colored glasses of victory, concerns over the US's methods in the days after X-Day up to X+93 have begun to be heard over the din of celebration. Was 11 instances of atomic fire coupled with the chemical devastation of Japan's rice crops really necessary? Critics now say that possibly if the US had been patient and had not invaded quite yet that maybe 2 or 3 bombs would have been enough..."
    twrusa.0.a:0 "THEY WERE IN THE TREES MAN!"
    twrusa.1.t:0 "The Twentieth Anniversary of V-Day"
    twrusa.1.d:0 "It's now been over twenty years after the war with Japan ended. The baby boom is practically over now and the first of the baby boomers are now adults of fighting age. The controversy over the use of weapons of mass destruction in the invasion of Japan is now one of the many subjects the college-bound children of Pacific War GIs might debate about in and even out of their classrooms. Nevertheless, the world goes on a-turning and the GIs of that war become older. Many of them refuse to talk about their experiences. The world has changed much since then..."
    twrusa.1.a:0 "Damned kids oughta get a job!"
    twrusa.2.t:0 "The United States in 1952"
    twrusa.2.d:0 "The United States, as it sees itself, is a shining example of democracy and freedom in the world, having triumped over the Japanese Empire in the Pacific War and standing as a bulwark against Nazi Germany and their sphere of oppression.\n\nThe short war of 1939-1940 in western Europe quickly ended between the United Kingdom and Germany while America, sticking to neutrality in the conflict, kept a strong gaze on the Japanese Empire. In December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in an attempt to wipe out the US Pacific Fleet and allow their forces to seize the European colonies in Eastern Asia to gain vital resources for the draining war in China. America spent years of bloody fighting against Japanese guerilla defenders, banzai charges and kamikaze attacks, building up to Operation Olympic and the siege of the Japanese homeland. Japan surrendered after the most costly fighting American troops had every faced in their nation's history, and our GIs returned home as exhausted heroes.\n\nThe Pacific war, despite its human cost, turned our nation into a military and economic powerhouse. We stand as the strongest capitalist and democratic nation, greatest trading hub globally and the largest economy on Earth. However, elsewhere times have grown dark as Germany continues to oppress large swathes of Europe under the brutal jackboot of Nazi racial oppression. While Britain falls from its superpower status, we rise and take the mantle of the Guardian of Democracy.\nCan America sit content with German oppression or is it time that we show the Germans there can only be one Eagle?"
    twrusa.2.a:0 "God bless America!"
    twrusa.3.t:0 "Independence Day"
    twrusa.3.d:0 "Today America celebrates her independence day. It was on this day in 1776 that the Continental Congress adopted our Declaration of Independence from Great Britain. Written by Thomas Jefferson, the words are etched in eternity, serving as pure inspiration to freedom loving people throughout the world. \nIndeed, it is evident that our nation has served as an idea, an idea that guides the world forwards. At the time of our declaration, few republics had stood the test of time. Our act was revolutionary not just in America, but the world. \nIt's important that we reflect on this date as a lesson. A lesson that teaches us freedom in a time where we face great threats to our liberty around us. We must never let Liberty's torch go out, lest it no longer be the shining light to show us from evil."
    twrusa.3.a:0 "America! America! God shed His grace on thee!"
    twrusa.4.t:0 "Victory Over Japan Day"
    twrusa.4.d:0 "October 26th, 1945 - a date which will live in honor. Less than four years after the atrocity that was the Attack of Pearl Harbor, we saw justice served. The Japanese led a campaign of total fantasy, holding everyone but their own in complete contempt, they fought nothing in the world could stop them. The Japanese atrocites of the Pacific War, and even before, should serve to us as a reminder of things that must never be repeated. Their crimes against peace and humanity can never be justified. \nWhile we remember the sacrifice many American boys made, we also celebrate our long commitment to peace. We shall never hesitate in order to defend our freedom and liberty."
    twrusa.4.a:0 "For the preservation of peace."
    twrusa.5.t:0 "Southern Tornado Outbreak"
    twrusa.5.d:0 "The past couple of days has been witness to one of the most deadly tornado outbreaks in U.S. history. Violent tornadoes ravaged the Southern United States, leaving nothing but destruction behind. It is believed over 200 people have been killed, and potentially up to 1000 people have been left injured. \nTornadoes are merciless, and these ones were no exception. They have left pure devastion."
    twrusa.5.a:0 "We must rebuild."
    twrusa.6.t:0 "Return French Territories"
    twrusa.6.d:0 "The territories annexed from France by Germany will be returned"
    twrusa.6.a:0 "Proceed"
    twrusa.7.t:0 "Liberate Poles, Czechs and Slovenes"
    twrusa.7.d:0 "The Czech and Polish people were annexed by Nazi Germany decades ago, and have suffered under the harshest imaginable occupation ever since. It is time they were granted their freedom once again, along with their Slavic brothers in the German-annexed region of Slovenia"
    twrusa.7.a:0 "Welcome back, Poles, Czechs and Slovenes!"
    twrusa.7.b:0 "Welcome back, Czechs and Slovenes!"
    twrusa.8.t:0 "East Prussia"
    twrusa.8.d:0 "The Poles were treated brutally by their Nazi occupiers. Millions of civilians died as the Germans tried aggressively to push out the native population. It is only right they be repaid for their suffering, and the territory of East Prussia could be a good start."
    twrusa.8.a:0 "The Polish People must be repaid"
    twrusa.8.b:0 "The Polish People will be repaid"
    twrusa.9.t:0 "Question of Silesia"
    twrusa.9.d:0 "The International Delegation has decided Silesia must not remain German. However, botht the Poles and the Czechs request the territory be transferred to them. The Poles certainly suffered the most and have a stronger claim to the territory, but the Czechs argue they deserve something. How should we proceed."
    twrusa.9.a:0 "All Silesia will be Polish"
    twrusa.9.b:0 "Partition Silesia between the Poles and Czechs"
    twrusa.10.t:0 "The New Germany"
    twrusa.10.d:0 "Now that the relevant territorial exchanges have been decided on, the new, post-Nazi system in Europe is almost complete. Now the question remains what to do with Germany itself. Debates have been held, and it is decided a heavily disarmed and de-industrialised 'German Confederal Union' will be created in the remaining territory. This state will be dimilitarised, disarmed and dismantled to such ane extent as to never threaten the world again, its government shall be as decentralised as possible, with individual 'states' within the Confederation having near total autonomy, and shall at first be under direct UN administration."
    twrusa.10.a:0 "Create the Confederation"
    twrusa.10.b:0 "Create the Confederation"
    twrusa.10.c:0 "Create the Confederation"
    twrusa.10.e:0 "Create the Confederation"
    twrusa.11.t:0 "Switzerland"
    twrusa.11.d:0 "The nation of Switzerland was one of the last in western Europe to fall to the Nazi menace. Its neutrality ignored, Hitler's armies overran the small nation, even against their valient defense in the mountains. The refounding of the Swizz nation will be recognised again."
    twrusa.11.a:0 "Proceed"
    twrusa.12.t:0 "The Low Countries"
    twrusa.12.d:0 "Now the conference must discuss the Low Countries.\n\n(If the Benelux Republic exists, only an option to recognise them will exist. If not, the Low Countries' governments in exile will be reinstated.)"
    twrusa.12.a:0 "Recognise the Republic"
    twrusa.12.b:0 "Reinstate the old Governments"
    twrusa.13.t:0 "The Saarland"
    twrusa.13.d:0 "The French delegation has requested that the Saarland be transferred back under French control, as it was for a time after the First World War, but this time in perpetuity. Should this go ahead?"
    twrusa.13.a:0 "Transfer the Saarland"
    twrusa.13.b:0 "The Saarland will remain German"
    twrusa.14.t:0 "Northern Schleswig"
    twrusa.14.d:0 "Finally, there is the question of Northern Schleswig. The region was formerly under Danish control. Should it be handed back?\n\n(Cannot be given to Nazi-controlled Denmark)"
    twrusa.14.a:0 "Yes"
    twrusa.14.b:0 "No"
    twrusa.15.t:0 "Education Reforms"
    twrusa.15.d:0 "The best way to ensure our values are maintained for the future is to instill them into the youth by education. Our reforms will have a twofold benefit, first by generally improving the education and literacy rate in the country, and also bringing more people towards our conservative, traditional values through our specific requirements."
    twrusa.15.a:0 "Educate the next generation!"
    twrusa.16.t:0 "Sending Weapons to Britain"
    twrusa.16.d:0 "With the sudden collapse of Nazi Germany into civil war, the fighting risks spilling outside the Reich's borders, and the threat to our allies' security is greater than ever. It is therefore important that we prepare our most powerful ally, and our great partner in Europe, Britain, for any eventuality. Some are suggesting we begin large shipments of weapons to accelerate their mobilisation and armament. Should we proceed?"
    twrusa.16.a:0 "Send them what we can"
    twrusa.16.b:0 "They are capable already"
    twrusa.17.t:0 "Invited to the Toronto Accord"
    twrusa.17.d:0 "With Nazi Germany becoming unstable, the we have received an invitation to the Toronto Accord alliance. While this could certainly improve our nation's security, it would also anger the Germans, a risky move. Should we accept?"
    twrusa.17.a:0 "Yes, we must join"
    twrusa.17.b:0 "No, refuse the offer"
    twrusa.18.t:0 "Portugal Accepts"
    twrusa.18.d:0 "Portugal has accepted our offer of joining the Toronto Accord. The first member on the main European continent, this could be the first big crack in Nazi control over mainland Europe, and improves our strategic situation immensely."
    twrusa.18.a:0 "Excellent"
    twrusa.19.t:0 "Portugal Refuses"
    twrusa.19.d:0 "Unfortunately, Portugal has refused our offer to join the Toronto Accord, citing their declared neutrality."
    twrusa.19.a:0 "Unfortunate"
    twrusa.20.t:0 "Invited to the Toronto Accord"
    twrusa.20.d:0 "With Nazi Germany becoming unstable, the we have received an invitation to the Toronto Accord alliance. While this could certainly improve our nation's security, it would also anger the Germans, a risky move. Should we accept?"
    twrusa.20.a:0 "Yes, we must join"
    twrusa.20.b:0 "No, refuse the offer"
    twrusa.21.t:0 "Sweden Accepts"
    twrusa.21.d:0 "Sweden has accepted our offer of joining the Toronto Accord. A country geographically close to Germany, this will certainly improve our alliance's strategic position, though it will increase tensions."
    twrusa.21.a:0 "Excellent"
    twrusa.22.t:0 "Sweden Refuses"
    twrusa.22.d:0 "Unfortunately, Sweden has refused our offer to join the Toronto Accord, citing their declared neutrality."
    twrusa.22.a:0 "Unfortunate"
    twrusa.23.t:0 "A Great Crusade - Direct Intervention?"
    twrusa.23.d:0 "As the civil war rages on in the once might 'Greater German Reich', years after its beginning with no end in sight, the evil empire continues to tear itself apart from the inside. The oppressed and enslaved peoples of Europe have risen up to challenge their oppressor, taking up arms with extreme bravery against the cruel Nazi occupiers who squabble amongst themselves.\n\nWith this continued disintegration of Germany's grip on the continent, an opportunity presents itself. With years of infighting and anarchy in central Europe, the German military is likely to be significantly destroyed at the hands of itself and rebel forces, as our reconaissance has suggested. Its nuclear weapons, the greatest deterrent to such a direct intervention, are likely to have been, in large part, destroyed or lost in the fighting. Of those that remain, the command structure required to deploy them cannot have survived without damage. Therefore, an increasingly vocal faction of all political and military branches within the United States and the Toronto Accord governments are calling for a direct intervention, to stamp out the Nazi menace once and for all.\n\nOthers, however, insist that the risks are too great. Despite the civil war, there remains the chance that factions of the German military could respond with nuclear strikes, a risk that, they say, cannot be countenanced, at least for the time being. At the same time, many are saying we cannot stand idly by with a chance to end the Nazi regime once and for all and bring its reign of death and terror to an end.\n\nThe other Toronto Accord governments have, at this point, agreed to accept any decision by the United States, despite disagreements within their own governments. The final decision lies with you, Mr. President."
    twrusa.23.a:0 "Launch The Great Crusade!"
    twrusa.23.b:0 "We cannot take the risk... yet"
    twrusa.24.t:0 "Naval Exercises"
    twrusa.24.d:0 "With Germany in chaos, it is important our armed forces are prepared for any eventuality. We will launch a large naval exercise, simulating naval warfare and amphibeous landings, in the North Sea and English channel, working together with our Toronto Accord partners to prepare our forces."
    twrusa.24.a:0 "Launch the exercise"
    twrusa.25.t:0 "Senators Criticise Policy"
    twrusa.25.d:0 "Debate rages in the US Senate, as opposition Senators fiercely attack the policies persued by the current administration. Fiery speeches are heard through the long hours, as even some of those Senators in the same party as the President begin to be persuaded against the policies of their own administration. If we let it continue, it seems these debates will negatively impact our support in the Senate, which could make it harder to pass legislation and enact policies in the future.\n\nWe could attempt to hit back, instructing our loyal Senators to defend the President's administration and denounce those who criticise him as not having the good of the country at heart, but such a strategy could easily backfire if we are seen as too belligerent."
    twrusa.25.a:0 "Let them complain"
    twrusa.25.b:0 "Hit back"
    twrusa.26.t:0 "House Representatives Criticise Policy"
    twrusa.26.d:0 "Debate rages in the US House of Representatives, as opposition Representatives fiercely attack the policies persued by the current administration. Fiery speeches are heard through the long hours, as even some of those Representatives in the same party as the President begin to be persuaded against the policies of their own administration. If we let it continue, it seems these debates will negatively impact our support in the House, which could make it harder to pass legislation and enact policies in the future.\n\nWe could attempt to hit back, instructing our loyal Representatives to defend the President's administration and denounce those who criticise him as not having the good of the country at heart, but such a strategy could easily backfire if we are seen as too belligerent."
    twrusa.26.a:0 "Let them complain"
    twrusa.26.b:0 "Hit back"
    twrusa.27.t:0 "US Congress Mechanic"
    twrusa.27.d:0 "The USA in TWR makes use of a Congress mechanic similar, but not the same, as the one used in Man the Guns. The Congress UI can be opened by clicking the congress icon on the political overview screen, as shown in the image attached. From here, political power can be spent to increase support in both houses of congress for 100pp for 5% support.\n\nSome focuses, events and decisions, especially those relating to domestic policy, will require at least 50% support in both houses of congress to enact. Occasionally, events will happen randomly that affect the amount of support, but it is likely some pp will have to be spent every now and then to keep support above 50%.\n\nAdditionally, if support in both houses of Congress is more than 50%, you will recieve a powerful 'Congress Majority' modifier which gives +50% political power gain."
    twrusa.27.a:0 "Cool!"
    twrusa.28.t:0 "Senators Criticise Policy"
    twrusa.28.d:0 "Debate rages in the US Senate, as opposition Senators fiercely attack the policies persued by the current administration.

    twrusa.32.t:0 "Sino-Vietnamese War"
    twrusa.32.d:0 "As the Chinese army continues to pour into Vietnam, it has become clear this is a deliberate, full-scale invasion by our former ally. While we may not be the biggest supporters of a communist regime ordinarily, China's recent expansion threatens our position in the Far East and Pacific. This most recent invasion clearly shows Nanking has set its sights on regional hegemony, a clear threat to our own interests and those of our allies. Discussions will have to be had on what to do about this."
    twrusa.32.a:0 "Interesting developments"
    twrusa.33.t:0 "Aiding the Vietnamese?"
    twrusa.33.d:0 "It is clear that with China's strong foreign policy moves in East Asia, a Chinese victory in Vietnam would be disadvantageous to our own interests, only strengthening Nanjing's power in the region and threatening our own position in the Asia-Pacific. Some officials have suggested a somewhat... radical option, of actively supplying communist Vietnam with small arms and other military aid through secret shipments, in order to help prop them up in the fight against China. Of course, some have scoffed at such a suggestion, refusing it on the grounds of supplying communists or saying it could destabilise the region or, if discovered by China, be a significiant diplomatic crisis. How shall we proceed, Mr. President?"
    twrusa.33.a:0 "Prepare to aid them"
    twrusa.33.b:0 "We can't do it"
    twrusa.34.t:0 "Kaiser Jeep"
    twrusa.34.d:0 "The Willys Jeep has been a staple of the US military for many years, providing a basic motorised transportation vehicle for the army. Now, a merger between Kaiser Motors and the Willys-Overland Company has created a new automotive manufacturer, which will continue to be available to produce these vehicles for our armed forces."
    twrusa.34.a:0 "Great!"
    twrusa.35.t:0 "Opening the Civil Rights Debate"
    twrusa.35.d:0 "With 'civil disobedience' by the civil rights movement becoming more and more widespread, and opposition building against the Jim Crow laws that plague much of this country, civil rights have for the first time been discussed seriously in Congress. Congress, in response, is deeply divided. Some figures strongly denounce these racist policies, demanding their repeal as soon as possible, while southern Democrats and others fiercely defend the rights of states under the constitution to choose their laws and way of governing. Yet more try to propose some form of compromise, lest this issue tear the nation apart.\n\nWith the lack of progress, what's clear is that this is only the beginning of the Civil Rights debate, and certainly more is to come."
    twrusa.35.a:0 "We'll see where this goes"
    twrusa.36.t:0 "Backlash Against Desegregation"
    twrusa.36.d:0 "The recent actions towards desegregation by the current administration, while broadly supported, have met strong and vocal resistance from segregationists, especially in the south. Controversy over the move has led to some loss of political support from these groups."
    twrusa.36.a:0 "Let them complain."
    twrusa.37.t:0 "Covert Preparations Complete"
    twrusa.37.d:0 "All the necessary preparations have been made. We can now attempt to support a coup in the country and overthrow its government. There is, of course, some unavoidable chance of failure, but the best chance to succeed is now."
    twrusa.37.a:0 "Good"

    twrusa.38.t:0 "High Congress Support"
    twrusa.38.d:0 "With a majority of supportive congress members in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the political power of our administration has been significantly boosted."
    twrusa.38.a:0 "Good"
    twrusa.39.t:0 "Loss of Congress Support"
    twrusa.39.d:0 "As we know longer have a clear majority of supportive congress members in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the political power of our administration has been significantly curbed."

    twrusa.53.t:0 "Surge of Nazi Terrorism"
    twrusa.53.d:0 "The unrest in occupied Germany has again broken out into a near insurgency, with a surge of terrorist attacks targetting civilians and our occupying forces alike. Troop transports are ambushed or blown up, occupying forces assassinated, and German politicians taking part in the UN attacked.\n\nAs a result of recent attacks, our forces in Germany are now conducting a wave of counter-terrorist operations, attempting to root out and destroy Nazi cells."

It's a special day here at the Watsons Home for Crippled Children.\n\nDr. Jonas Salk stares at the lines of children sitting and standing in the aisles behind the crowded clinic, and prepares his next dose of the polio vaccine. There is much work to be done before the day comes to it's close, and data to be gathered. If everything goes well, and there is no guarantee that it will, the disease which killed Roosevelt's legs and has robbed millions of a healthy life might be stopped. Eradicated, even, given sufficient time.\n\nBut if it does not… He wrestles the thought from his consciousness.

Then they are injected with what might be, or might not be, the cure for the malaise which crippled President Roosevelt.\n\nThe cure has worked in all levels of testing, human and animal. Through the production of chemicals which kill polio virus but leave chemical traces in the bloodstream, the vaccine forces the immune systems it enters to produce antibodies in an act of immunological magic. If everything works well, the vaccine will ensure that the host remains inoculated against Polio for the rest of his lifetime.\n\nEveryone involved knows this, and certainly the official stance is one of confidence, but there is also the unspoken elephant in the room no one dares to address. There is a small but not insignificant chance that the vaccine virus samples might remain alive; in other words, the vaccines might cause polio instead of ending its spread.

Already Ruppelt has ideas brewing in his mind about how best to file the glut in post-war UFO sightings: perhaps the computers that the eggheads have running at the Battelle Memorial Institute are a suitable substitute for malleable paper? In any case, the team's best inclinations are sharply divided between ideas about where these appearances are coming from, and so it might be best to clear their heads - and clear any members with too strongly held opinions out of the team.\n\nHe has in his pocket a letter from Chief of the Air Force, Hoyt S.

Harry Barnes, senior ATC officer, will later tell the press that the movements were \"completely radical compared to those of ordinary aircraft\". The two glance anxiously at each other. Could this be a new, unannounced Luftwaffe flight from Germania? The phone to Andrews Air Force Base lies ominously on the desk. No one wants to be responsible for starting the next World War over the skies of the nation's capital.\n\nNearby controllers start yelling in concern and confusion.

In a panic, Andrews AFB is dialed, and the airman on the phone answers in mounting confusion to an ATC officer so hysterical he is initially assumed to be under narcotic influences. The Air Force Base Tower begins reporting sights of an object \"like an orange ball of fire, trailing a tail\", before the object veers off at high speed.\n\nSightings and reports continue throughout the day, some believable, others less so. 3 Air Force Starfire Jets attempt to sortie with the intruders, but the objects vanish, only to reappear when the jets return to base.

They say it is the highest turn out for a press conference since the beginning of the Pacific war.\n\nThe Major-Generals walk into the room and the crowds rise, applauding as they take their seat. Roger Ramsey, USAF Director of Operations, and John Samford, Director of Intelligence, are brief in their opening comments. They emphasize that there is no need for popular panic and that the phenomena observed during the Washington D.C. Incident were in fact entirely explainable by natural causes (although of course many of them have been too poorly documented to be applicable). He points to natural light sources like light sources or passing aircraft far overhead, on classified paths only available to the military. Samford comments that hundreds of similar encounters by USAF jets have been logged in records, and in fact that there is a team investigating such causes to make them better understood. He calls them the Project Blue-Book.\n\nThe Major Generals leave satisfied that they have calmed the American public down, but what the public really hears is that the Government has no idea what the Visitors are either, that they have a project hoarding needed data from the American public, and that the project is called Blue-Book.

The nation is bracing itself for an invasion from the skies, and who is to say that this will not be preceded by the atomic fire they have come to know so well across the Pacific?\n\nThe manager of Project Blue Book comes to monitor the ATC tower, but refuses to answer questions: he watches over the next few days as screens continue to report the anomalous entities across the airspace above the Capital. This only fuels the speculation further, and by the end of the month pundits comment that perhaps the manager is in League with the Visitors. In fact, a great many earthly powers are being blamed for the incidents, chief among them the Fascists across the Atlantic. After all, the Germans stand the most to gain from the attack on Washington, and who is to say that their claims about the present state of the Luftwaffe are not some kind of cover-up?\n\nOne incident, in particular, will captivate the American media and government: bright lights are caught flashing on the surface of the river near the National Airport, in bizarre patterns that defy logic - but they appear to be organized. Pundits yell into cameras about how this is clearly an attempt to communicate, and independent code-breakers get to work. 5 days later, the news comes out that this is simply another Air Force experiment to communicate through focused light signals that happened to be reflected by a passing balloon.

    twrusaflavour.20.d:0 "It's always the same bar, always the same time of day. The Agency makes sure to make the intervals between meetings irregular to avoid suspicion, but it is easier to set up counter-surveillance equipment with a routine schedule in place. The shadow agency was set up with the help of the Rockefeller Foundation and a few private donors who were contacted beforehand, but it's always the Agents who do the talking.\n\nThe artists are usually somewhat reluctant: even though they don't know precisely who they're talking to beyond a vague notion of immensely wealthy and discreet private foundations, they're inherently distrustful of blank cheques, and what the ‘Foundation' offers is the mother of all blank cheques. Pollock stammers out an initial refusal after hearing about the size of his payout, De Kooning nearly chokes on his tequila (a very expensive drink, the Agent reports) and Motherwell nearly walks out of the bar. Nevertheless, the three artists agree after extensive pleading and assurance that nothing will be tampered with in terms of artistic virtue.\n\nThen comes the surveying of the works, and here the contacts are truly out of their depth: the CIA hires all sorts, but it does not hire art critics, and the officers struggle to come up with meaningful comments on the walls of color come to life. Paint arcs in vivid trajectories across the canvas like a ballerina executing a cross-room maneuver, dots and smears leap with abandon and splay themselves like little children performing, and the canvases are so vivid they almost sear themselves into the retina. But the Agents manage to conduct themselves well even here, and they manage to secure the artists' consent for the project. One last spit in the face of the Thousand-Year Reich, in galleries across free Europe. Hopefully Hitler will have an aneurysm if he hasn't had one already."

    twrusaflavour.21.d:0 "The artist formerly known as Barnett Newman (Barney to his friends) lives in an apartment quickly emptying out, much like his career. He's been reduced to pawning valuables to keep himself and his spouse afloat. That, and betting on horse races like all the other desperate men and women in the city. And the canvas before him, day after day, sits empty. After a string of rejections from exhibitions and museums, he's sold away virtually all his portfolio, and since he stopped producing works in 1951 he didn't have much capital to begin with. Artists are not known for their practicality, but Newman is tired, and something inside him is straining beyond its limits. He knows he's a man running out of time and dry on inspiration.\n\nThe knock on the door comes. He opens it expecting someone else to foreclose on him or stop lending him money. What the man at the door proposes is something entirely different. The shadowy Foundation that's been sponsoring the likes of Pollock, De Kooning and Motherwell is offering a lucrative bonus to him - but they don't want his usual art, or the same fare the Masters of Abstract Expressionism are creating in their million-dollar studios. What the CIA wants is an artistic commentary on the Nazi state's policies against those it deems inferior, the monstrosity of Nazi brutality and its focus on the Semitic cultures, and a nuanced, sympathetic depiction of the Jewish condition. And who else to do it but the most famous Jewish Expressionist of the 1950s?\n\nNewman nods. He doesn't really have a choice, not for the paycheck they're offering him. And he's had a few ideas roaming around in his head, about bright lines and scorching Godlike horizons, about the Jewish mythos laid bare in flat vivid lines. Interrogating and accusatory, but fundamentally human, fundamentally vulnerable. He'll call his first work Adam, and it will be a series. For Barnett Newman has had an idea whose time has come, and ideas rarely stay on the schedules they were created on."

The hungry, the dispossessed, the fearful - and the scarred. 6 years after the surrender of Japan, their last casualties live on in people seared by the atomic fire, in invisible wounds that will never heal so long as their carriers remain alive.\n\nRadiation poisoning was a poorly understood topic at the time of the bombings in the Olympic Campaign, and its true effects first came to light with the treatment of thousands of US soldiers suffering from what would become known as Advanced Radiation Sickness: airburst-type weapons ripped tons of radioactive earth into the atmosphere like a hammer of the Gods, spraying it on friend and foe alike, sending invisible bullets through concrete, metal, cloth and flesh. The monstrosities recorded in the civilian death toll and the overwhelming of hospitals in the newly occupied Japan made headlines worldwide, but the cancers and the prolonged burns the nuclear bombings induced were only discovered later, and the Veterans' Medical Administration continues to struggle with patients it can not afford to treat.\n\nDespite this, many vets across the nation remain proud of their efforts, saying they would have done it again had they the chance. But each winter there are fewer of them as more collapse in the hospital and die of horrific tumors. And more are saying that the Government has failed in its duty to those who have served it, claiming the American ideal means little to those who must now suffer the mistargeted wrath of the eagle's sword."

Perhaps the most ardent of segregationists, Thurmond categorically, if dubiously, rejects accusations of racism, and in fiery speeches has accused anti-segregation politicians of promoting totalitarian rule over states, which he compares to the Nazi rule of Europe. These most extreme of comparisons convince few beyond his base, and those who oppose him most would quickly compare his own support of racial policies to those of the regimes across the Atlantic.\n\nNonetheless, for now, Thurmond has won, and can proudly consider himself 'Leader of the Free World'... for now. As while his administration establishes itself, already the voices of dissent against his reactionary attitudes to social reform and his rhetoric builds. Few, apart from his most religious supporters, predict his Presidency to be a stable one.\n\nOnly time can tell what this will mean for the United States."

Washington-Williams herself has declined to comment, but is thought to have admitted in private that this was the case. Strom Thurmond has also not yet admitted nor denied the allegations, but it is likely that with mounting evidence, a denial will not be taken seriously\n\nFor obvious reasons, the news comes as a great shock to the nation, to see a many so driven by the ideal of separation of the races to have such a secret. Within days, Thurmond's fragile political reputation and career has been shattered.

Instead she watches the cityscape melt and flow in the spray of the rain across the window, as the bus fills up with other tired commuters.The conductor, noting that the rows reserved for white people are filling up steadily, moves the sign indicating the black-white row boundary back by 10 seats.

Emmett Till is off the papers in a country still haunted by Jim Crow's ghost, but his face is fresh in her mind. And the election of Thurmond, the man with an empty smile and a dagger to the minorities of America, makes it clear what the white man will always choose.\n\nShe makes the most important decision she will ever make.

She will be a martyr for a community under the boot of the Southern laws, and they will whip the flames into an inferno that will sweep the nation. And with stagnation shriveling the civil rights movement and a segregationist President, perhaps an inferno will be necessary to truly wake the nation, as Ezekiel did.\n\nNixon meets with local black ministers in a series of assemblies, outlining his strategy to boycott the Bus Line that makes Montgomery tick. If they succeed in bringing the city's main arteries down, they'll bring the cameras of the nation - and the world - upon them all. And they'll send a message for the racist in the Oval Office, the one they call the Smiling Dixiecrat or, more controversially, the Southern Nazi; the black community will struggle tooth and nail against their yoke.\n\nBut the clergymen are reluctant: having lived their whole lives in the city, they fear the wrath of the city's elites and by extension the effects on their own incomes. The collection bowl is a fragile thing, and easily broken. Incensed, Nixon calls them hypocrites for taking from the purses of the African-American community while adding nothing to their burden.\n\nThen Nixon's personal favourite, a young minister fresh to the city, volunteers, saying he is not afraid of the wrath of men. The words hang heavy in the thick summer air. The minister is elected president of the Montgomery Improvement Association. But soon Martin Luther King will be far more than that."

Montgomery begins to crumble as social norms burn in the fervid summer air. The FBI takes notice, but can do little. And crowds gather for demonstrations that barely, just barely, escape becoming riots. Sullen eyes, harsh glares; American unity is showing cracks.\n\nBut that's not all the black community in America is doing. Strident voices have blossomed, like poisoned flowers, on every street corner in the many segregated communities of the South. In hushed tones, just loud enough to draw attention, they suggest that in light of the present electoral circumstances the boycott will not be enough. Some greater thing must take place. Something more - dare it be said? - radical.\n\nThe counterattack from the Whites Only movement proceeds. Pamphlets are thrown about calling the boycott a \"violation of natural and civic law.\" Counter-protests blossom alongside the Montgomery protests. The crucible simmers. And President Thurmond, the man they are calling the Genial Judas of the South, says nothing.\n\nOne night, a series of houses around Montgomery go up in flames, with the grace of distant bonfires.

A series of riots hammers the black and white communities, as furious mobs engage in mass violence on the streets. Law and order breaks down. One, then two, then three streets are burnt to the ground. Men, women, children are caught between the burning house and the violence of the streets, and some perish in the gap.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr is hospitalized, but by a stroke of fate his entire family survives, having been out of town at the time. In vain he issues statements from his hospital bed, calling for calm to be restored. It is to no avail; the men mobilized in his name have been driven beyond reason. Revenge is the watchword, and the motive, and the endgame; for a community pushed to the edge there is nothing else.\n\nBlack leaders who survive the firebombings struggle to maintain control, but the initiative has been taken out of their hands. Incensed voices in the few black churches untouched by the hands of the mob or the cleansing of the flame call for outright revolt. No moderates are left to stop them. Everything is spiralling out of control with the inevitable grace of a crashing plane.\n\nAs isolated riots break out in neighbouring cities and America trembles in fear, all eyes look to the President. Fifty to a hundred have already perished in the lawless night. The casualty count rises daily, and there is no break in the violent clouds enveloping America."

Over the images of rioting and fear and civil breakdown, it is almost easy to believe him.\n\nKing and 88 other ministers are arrested for conspiracy, along with hundreds of other convicted of mob violence and inciting civil disorder. They turn themselves in as an act of defiance, spending two weeks in jail rather than pay a fine they disagree with for a crime they are innocent of. The National Guard sent to arrest them are met with almost unprecedented hatred. As one Guardsman says in a speech that will be repeated by pundits nationwide, \"it's like them black folk done got conquered, not arrested. They fly our flags, but in their eyes they ain't our countrymen no more.\"\n\nGroups like the Club from Nowhere continue their efforts to support what's left of the peaceful protests, but at this point there is no neutral ground left to hide on. The Club is accused of poisoning their dinners when serving white men, and quickly declines into irrelevance. They will join a long line of casualties in the slow-burn of the Civil Rights War, as it is being called on televisions and over tense dinner tables. And this is true of every war:"

A surprise announcement from the Scion of Television himself, Edward R.

Rifles and boots and buttons are polished to glistening perfection. At last the battalion commander, a cheerful veteran of the First World War, calls his soldiers to rest. The few photographers in the camp are immediately swamped by last-minute platoons and buddies looking to keep their friends in immortal memory - the queues nearly delay the ceremony itself in their length.\n\nIn the evening hours the battalion is assembled one last time, for one last parade. The battalion marches, turns and salutes the General Staff members gathered to watch, as well as the audience gathered behind them. One final round around the parade square, a march-out, and then it is over. Soldiers, teary-eyed as if they had just been proposed to, share last hugs and embraces with their buddies. Friends wish each other well in the battalions they will be sent to after the unit's disbanding, knowing this meeting might be their last.\n\nThe lights shine bright in the camp well after silent hours that night, and when the sun comes up its light shines upon a silent and empty barracks - and 500 men who will never forget."

The US Government, after all, is an indiscriminate client, even if it has the deepest pockets in the world.\n\nThe tubes are destined for bulky new computers, shipped into Langley and Arlington and a half-dozen other Government centres.

The power usage is immense, of course, but experts are optimistic. Soon new circuit-board designs will reduce energy expenditure and raise efficiency - perhaps one day computers will be small enough to fit in the household home, bringing the wonders of the universe to the average American.\n\nNew sciences are being discussed by the masters of this new space - a cyber-space, if you will - sciences freed from the frailty of human intellect, examining all manner of social and material phenomena with the aid of infallible machine-thought.

Perhaps, he sighs, some future president will change things. In any case, there is always room for things to get worse before they get better.\n\nThe US Armed Forces, in their buzzing hives of clustered thought, come to the same conclusion: their increasing patronage of, and collaboration with, the corporations of the nation is likely to continue into the foreseeable future.

They bring harrowing stories with them, of a continent ruled by fear and brutality. From Eastern Europe in particular, in the Nazi 'Reichskommissariats' and other colonies, tales describe suffering and slaughter wrought on its people on a scale not seen since the days of the Mongols. It is clear that the 'victory' of the German race over 'inferior' European races was not empty rhetoric from Hitler, as tens of millions deemed 'subhuman' are butchered, bullied, beaten, starved and enslaved across the continent.  Those that escape the bullets fight and struggle for enough food to survive, with the authorities extracting grain for the German state and its 'brave' settlers in the east, to the detriment of the starving millions.\n\nOf course, with Germania making every effort to hide the reality of the situation, information is scattered and unclear.

    twrusaflavour.45.d:0 "With the outbreak of civil war in Germany, major shocks have hit the global economy. Trade between the west and German-dominated Europe, though already far below pre-1939 levels, ground entirely to a halt as the European continent collapses into total anarchy. Already scarce resource imports from mainland Europe have been cut to zero instantaneously, leading to a sudden increase in costs for some American firms. Inflation has shot up as a result."

    twrusaflavour.47.t:0 "Iraqi Oil Shock"
    twrusaflavour.47.d:0 "Iraq's young republican government has, unfortunately, made no pretense of its anti-British and anti-western position. It comes as little surprise, then, that Iraq's large oil supplies have been nationalised. With Iraq being one of the world's largest oil producers, this has had a not insignificant effect on the price of oil, which has affected our own industries that rely on cheap and reliable oil. As a result, inflation has noticeably increased."

    twrusaflavour.48.t:0 "War in the Middle East"
    twrusaflavour.48.d:0 "With war having broken out in the Middle East between Syria and Iraq, oil supplies from the region have become significantly disrupted. While Iraq and the Persian Gulf is by no means the only source of oil, it makes a large proportion of world supply. The sudden increase in oil prices has caused increased costs for domestic industries, which are passed onto consumers and lead to price increases. The result has been a significant increase in inflation."

    twrusaflavour.50.t:0 "Access to Saudi Oil"
    twrusaflavour.50.d:0 "As part of its Middle Eastern foreign policy initiative, the British have signed a deal with the Saudis giving western, particularly British, companies greater rights over newly discovered oil, in return for a guarantee of their independence and defensive alliance. This has given both us and the British greater access to a cheap oil supply going forwards, and global oil prices have fallen somewhat."

    twrusaflavour.51.d:0 "After a series of heated negotiations, Iran, once sympathetic to the Germans, has bowed to British demands (with associated threats) to grant British and American oil companies significant ownership and rights over its oil fields. With Iran being one of the world's largest oil producers, global oil prices have fallen significantly, especially for America's oil consuming industries."

    twrusaflavour.52.t:0 "War in the Gulf"
    twrusaflavour.52.d:0 "War has broken out in the Persian Gulf involving Iran! This has significantly disrupted a huge part of global oil supplies, with oil output via the Gulf from such producers as Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and the Trucial States all being significantly affectd, sending oil prices skyrocketing!"

    twrusaflavour.54.t:0 "United States Military"
    twrusaflavour.54.d:0 "A generation ago, the United States was not a military superpower. On the eve of the wars of the 1940s, America had a powerful navy, but little else, its land army and air force relatively small compared to the world's other great powers. When Hitler overran Europe and brought Britain to heel, this began to change, as President Franklin Roosevelt could see the danger America was in. However, the strike on America would come not from Europe, but from the east, with Japan's surprise strike on US Naval forces at Pearl Harbor kicking off the Pacific War. At that moment, the goliath American economy was mobilised for war, and very soon the US was producing more weapons and war materials than any other country on earth, even as the Germans ground their way deeper into the Soviet Union. Systematically, and over a period of years, the Japanese war machine was comprehensively defeated at sea, in the air, and eventually, on land with the invasion and subsequent eventual surrender of Japan.\n\nYet America would not repeat the mistakes of the last major war it was involved in. After victory, America did not rest on its laurels, confident in its safety. As Americans celebrated Victory in Japan, a victory of freedom over tyranny and brutality, the Germans celebrated their opposite victory, that of evil over good. Europe lay enslaved, its resources and people used to fuel the Nazi war machine. While America did demobilise after 1945, it did so slowly and partially, and to this day, its military strength, accounting for all branches of the military and military-industrial power, is arguably the strongest in the world. With Britain weak, America now stands as the torch-bearer and guardian of democracy, and its armed forces, on land, air and sea, its weapons against tyranny."
    twrusaflavour.54.a:0 "One day, we'll fight again"
    twrusaflavour.55.t:0 "Patton's Doctrine"
    twrusaflavour.55.d:0 "George S. Patton is certainly one of the more eccentric US military planners, even leaving aside his unusual and ambiguous, and seemingly sometimes positive, opinion of Nazi Germany. At the same time, though, what he also is is innovative. Whether from his own mind, or looking at the German Blitzkrieg in Europe, he has developed his own doctrine of mobile warfare. Motorisation and speed, more than raw firepower, is seen as key, to outmaneuver, bypass and encircle the enemy in a similar manner to what the Germans achieved in Europe.\n\nUnfortunately for him, there was little opportunity to test his ideas during the Pacific War, as fighting took place almost entirely on mountainous islands and without the wide open spaces needed for rapid mobile warfare. For future wars, notably against the Germans, however, a new doctrine that matches what the Germans have could be very useful. Perhaps it's about time we look more seriously into what this madman has to offer."
    twrusaflavour.55.a:0 "Maybe Patton's not all crazy"
    twrusaflavour.56.t:0 "Firepower Doctrine"
    twrusaflavour.56.d:0 "If it ain't broke, don't fix it! That's the motto that's got many people through problems before, and there's no reason to abandon it now. The Pacific War showed the need for bigger guns, bigger bombs and more concentrated heavy weapons to comprehensively destroy the enemy wherever it made a stand. America's unmatched economic and industrial potential certainly lends itself to this method of fighting, as we have the necessary industrial base to build more and bigger weapons in larger numbers than anyone else. The Germans might have done well with their 'Blitzkrieg', but we have our own way of doing things, whatever that old madman Patton might have to say about it."
    twrusaflavour.56.a:0 "No need to change what's worked before"
    twrusaflavour.57.t:0 "The US Army"
    twrusaflavour.57.d:0 "Despite traditionally being the most important part of most military forces, the US Army, the forces responsible for war on land, are perhaps the least tested of the three. While the Navy and Air Force clashed dramatically with the Japanese during the Pacific War, for most of the conflict, the army was relegated to more minor operations. That was, until the invasion of the Japanese Home Islands commenced. In contrast the sweeping and rapid wars of movement and encirclement in Europe, the US army fought a slow, brutal, methodical war of attrition, where dogged and fanatic Japanese defence was slowly destroyed, inch by inch, until the surrender.\n\nAs valuable as this experience was, it has not given a more thorough experience of modern warfare in general that the European powers have experienced. For now, with America protected by sea and air, the army is not as crucial, but as a more active involvement in Europe becomes more and more likely, the US Army, smaller than its German counterpart at least on paper, may have to expand and develop itself for the tasks ahead."
    twrusaflavour.57.a:0 "This We'll Defend!"
    twrusaflavour.58.t:0 "The US Navy"
    twrusaflavour.58.d:0 "Perhaps most of all, it was the US navy that was tested and excelled in the last war. Despite Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Habor, the US navy, backed by the industrial might of America behind them, rose up to the task. Its carriers comprehensively smashed those of the Japanese in decisive battles for control over the Pacific, opening up the way to an invasion of Japan. More than anything else, the war taught that the age of battleships is over and carriers now rule the seas. The US navy has certainly taken this lesson to heart, constructing a huge number of carriers to rule the seas project naval air power rapidly across continents. Today, America's navy has taken the title of the world's strongest from the British, and expansion continues, as even larger carrier designs are discussed. The next war, just like the last, will show the importance of control of the seas. It is important that America is ready."
    twrusaflavour.58.a:0 "Non sibi sed patriae"
    twrusaflavour.59.t:0 "The US Air Force"
    twrusaflavour.59.d:0 "The best demonstration of America's economic power translating into military potential may be the use of the US Air Force. During the Pacific War, the industrial giant of America awoke, and tens of thousands of aircraft were built. Thousands of heavy bombers ruthlessly obliterated Japanese cities from the skies before and after the land invasion commenced, showing the might of modern air power. While the Germans concentrated on smaller bombers and close air support to directly aid their attacking spearheads on the ground, America, it seems, has chosen overwhelming strategic bombing as its doctrine, and has the industrial might to match. As new innovations such as the jet engine are developed and exploited on both sides of the Atlantic, it is clear any future war will be decided in part by air power."
    twrusaflavour.59.a:0 "Aim High ... Fly-Fight-Win"
    twrusaflavour.60.t:0 "Lessons from Japan"
    twrusaflavour.60.d:0 "Overwhelming air power was instrumental in the defeat of Japan. During the later stages of the Pacific War, the US Army Air Service, the predecessor of the modern USAF, gained air superiority over the Japanese Home Islands and then reduced its industries and cities to ruin through strategic bombing. If this success is to be repeated in the next war, the lessons learned from the 1940s must be taken on board for this new decade."
    twrusaflavour.60.a:0 "To victory!"
    twrusaflavour.61.t:0 "Legacy of the Pacific War"
    twrusaflavour.61.d:0 "More than any other conflict in recent times, the Pacific War changed the nature of naval warfare. Battleships, once the undisputed kings of the seas, were relegated to a secondary position behind carriers. America's carriers and other parts of its navy saw great success against Japan in the Pacific, but there is always room for improvement, especially with the foes that still remain. This war, and the lessons learned from it, must inform how we develop our navy for modern times."

    twrusaflavour.62.d:0 "The instability rocking Germany gives us an opportunity we can't afford to pass up - an opportunity to gain a strategic foothold in mainland Europe. Most of the continent is under German-influenced states, but not all of it. The State Department is confident that in this volatile situation, there are countries within Europe that could be encouraged to join the TA, which would massively help our strategic position. All we have left to do is open up diplomatic channels."

    twrusaflavour.63.t:0 "Naval Station Norfolk"
    twrusaflavour.63.d:0 "During the early 1940s, America's naval might was focused on the Pacific to fight the enemy of Japan. Now, however, as a new enemy has taken hold across the Atlantic, the focus of our sea power must increasingly face a new arena. Part of this is a need for larger naval bases on the east coast, especially as we build larger and larger carriers and other vessels. To this end, the Naval Operating Base at Norfolk, Virginia will be renamed Naval Station Norfolk and its infrastructure expanded significantly to form the centerpiece of our Atlantic naval strategy."
    twrusaflavour.63.a:0 "The seas will remain ours to control"
    twrusaflavour.64.t:0 "Naval Station San Diego"
    twrusaflavour.64.d:0 "Though the Atlantic has in recent times become the more important naval arena to our nation's defense and strategy, we should not forget the importance of our Pacific Fleet. The Japanese may be defeated, but now our former allies the Chinese are gaining confidence and filling the power vacuum left in East Asia. A proper modern naval base for our Pacific Fleet is required, and the naval base at San Diego must be upgraded to enhance our power projection in the Pacific."

    twrusaflavour.65.t:0 "Aerial Reconnaissance"
    twrusaflavour.65.d:0 "Getting detailed intelligence of our adversaries in Germany and Europe has always been an issue. What would be ideal is if we could simply fly over their territory and photograph it directly, but that couldn't be done without them simply stopping us... could it?\n\nAs jet aircraft begin to mature, ever more impressive feats are possible. Planes can now be built that can fly high up in the stratosphere, at sustained speeds unlike anything before. Theoretically, with this, we could simply fly over the enemy air defences or even their RADAR ceiling, out of reach from whatever they can bring to bear. Of course, the reality is we don't know the capabilities of enemy air defences, and sending planes straight over enemy airspace in times such as these would be profoundly risky, but perhaps it's a risk worth taking."

These, however, have outlived their usefulness, and for our New America, it is important we take control of all parts of government so as to decisively guide the country against external threats.\n\nThe first option is simply to dissolve both houses, and arrest all those who resist. This would maximise our control over the nation, but would of course be fiercely resisted.\n\nSecondly, we could attempt to puppet Congress, by inserting our own representatives and quietly removing those who resist us.
