GER_Military_Reforms_desc:0 "The Heer is a force that can only be saved through reform, both organisationally and training-wise. Anything other than complete reform will result in subpar performance and lacking improvement, which is unacceptable. Let us revive the grandest Army in the world from the ground up, and like a great phoenix, it shall rise more powerful than ever before."
GER_Formalize_Doctrines:0 "Formalize the Doctrines"
GER_Formalize_Doctrines_desc:0 "Despite the revolutionary concepts of Guderian and Lutz regarding Panzer divisions that have granted us outstanding success in the East and West, they have never been recognised or arranged into a proper military doctrine or concept. If the Heer is to act effectively, we shall either embrace manoeuvre warfare fully as a complete doctrinal force or renounce it entirely. We must choose a path to follow; that is the only way the Heer can continue to strive for greatness."
GER_Revitalize_Army:0 "Revitalize the Army"
GER_Revitalize_Army_desc:0 "The Heer has grown stagnant in the past decade, lacking proper equipment and squandering away the scant materiel that we do have. We must increase our efforts to not only produce more, but to ensure that no armament will be lost or misused due to bureaucracy or incompetency in the Heer’s ranks."
GER_Train_NCOs:0 "Train New NCOs"
GER_Train_NCOs_desc:0 "Non-commissioned officers are the base of every army, tasked with executing operations and instructing the soldiers under them in how to best reach the strategic goals that they must achieve. Despite their pivotal role in the smooth functioning of the Wehrmacht, the Heer suffers from a critical lack of well trained and well-educated NCOs to lead our men. Universities shall be expanded, schools must be built, and with effort and ingenuity, we shall succeed."
GER_Central_Research_Department:0 "Central Research Department"
GER_Central_Research_Department_desc:0 "Research and development in the Reich’s past has often been plagued with bureaucracy and lack of coordination between branches, heavily hampering our efforts to develop revolutionary new weapons and concepts.

GER_Total_Warfare:0 "Total Warfare"
GER_Total_Warfare_desc:0 "The Heer suffers not from an organisational or doctrinal issue. Instead, the problem is simple: not involving every citizen, from the lowliest housewife to the OKW leadership, in the Wehrmacht. We must make the Heer into an organisation encompassing the entire German nation; we must begin total war."
GER_Expand_Draft:0 "Expand the Draft"
GER_Expand_Draft_desc:0 "As of now, the strata of drafted population is a fairly small section, especially compared to when the war with the Soviets was still raging a decade ago. To strengthen our army back into shape, we shall expand the draft, drawing upon a massive reserve of older able-bodied men to fight for Germany in the Heer."
GER_Peoples_Storm:0 "People's Storm"
GER_Peoples_Storm_desc:0 "The Heer has, in its years of decline, suffered from a constant lack of enthusiasm and courage among the men.

GER_Purge_High_Command:0 "Purge the High Command"
GER_Purge_High_Command_desc:0 "The High Command of the Heer has long been suspected to harbour anti-Party sentiment, acting more as a deterrent to the Fuhrer’s ideas than as a support. If we are to rid the Heer from the rats that have burrowed inside it, a purge targeting the very top of the command structure is necessary. Despite possible negative short term effects, the entire Heer - and the entirety of Germany - will be better off without the traitors that call themselves generals and marshals."
GER_Reform_Recruitment_System:0 "Reform the Recruitment System"
GER_Reform_Recruitment_System_desc:0 "The current recruitment system that has been used for many years has begun to show its flaws. Many able-bodied men are not allowed to serve due to anachronistic restrictions, and when training does commence, it is slow and inefficient. This is absolutely unacceptable, and we shall begin a great restructuring process to improve the system. The Reich cannot tolerate this for any longer."
GER_Unify_Regional_Commands:0 "Unify the Regional Commands"
GER_Unify_Regional_Commands_desc:0 "The various regional theatres and army groups of the Heer act not in unison but in conflict with each other. The situation has devolved into a constant battle of bureaucrats and administrators attempting to get more men, more supplies, and more resources into their soldiers’ hands, to the detriment of the entire Wehrmacht. We shall finally rectify this error that has been allowed to fester for years by unifying the many regional commands into consolidated command structures, all under the watchful eye of Germania."

Now it is time to reinvent the U-Boat's use in warfare to suit a vastly changed naval environment.\n\nThere have, of course, been some worries as to whether the newfangled carriers of America will prove vulnerable to mere submarines. We have assured the Navy that we will modernize the rest of our forces to provide countermeasures to airpower and advanced strikes - let us hope we can actually follow through..."
GER_Expand_Dockyard_Capacity:0 "Expand Dockyard Capacity"

Just as our tanks and our armies overran one position after another in massed concentrations, so too shall our cruisers and submarines overwhelm the forces of international Jewry through sheer numbers as well!\n\nA little relaxation of safety standards, and rapid expansions in port facilities, will begin this process of expansion. Soon we will have a fleet that shall darken the seabed itself - and the skies will tremble with its firepower."
GER_Refit_Navy:0 "Refit the Navy"
GER_Refit_Navy_desc:0 "It is not enough to build one's way into naval dominance - one must also rebuild the old, for it would be a crime to consign these millions of wasted Reichsmarks to the wastepaper-bin of history. No matter how utterly terrible the Kriegsmarine is in its present state, we can at least salvage the armaments and hulls of our light vessels.\n\nWe will redesign our cruisers and destroyers to serve a lighter, more durable purpose in combat - this should also help with our crippling oil dependence, which will relieve the accountants thoroughly."
GER_Destroyer_Fleet:0 "Destroyer Fleet"
GER_Destroyer_Fleet_desc:0 "We have no need of an offensive fleet: it is a waste of money, a strategic inconvenience, and a drain on our resource deposits. What is needed is a fleet capable of rapid defense of our long shoreline, one that can respond to a variety of targets while retaining a uniformity of operating doctrine.\n\nThe answer to our problems is the destroyer: humble, lightweight, and so versatile the Americans have not yet abandoned it. Around this ship class the new German Navy will revolve!"
GER_Limit_Naval_Spendings:0 "Limit Naval Spendings"
GER_Limit_Naval_Spendings_desc:0 "We have committed to a sleek and downsized naval force, and now we must work to bring it into being. The first step will be downsizing the bloated maintenance budgets of the Navy, cutting forever our ties with the silent horror of the Schiessenflotte. Let us hope these battleships which serve no purpose and can barely stand straight at harbor can at least perform one vital function:\nAn efficient and cheap base for scrap metal."
GER_Submarine_Production:0 "Submarine Production"
GER_Submarine_Production_desc:0 "We have not quite forgotten the workhorses of our Navy, and the Unterseeboot programme is about to get overhauled and its funding expanded beyond its wildest dreams. The submarine must be rethought in every aspect to fit the new world and its frightening new technologies: new engines invented, efficiency increased.\n\nIt is a dream come true for the submarine-experts of the Kriegsmarine, and they will never see the nightmarish accounting arrears that are the cost of pursuing it. Let us pray they will never see the ugly truth."
GER_Capable_navy:0 "Capable Navy"

The High Seas Fleet and its nauseating stupidity, its delusion of grandeur, its ceaseless strategic burden, has ended. Now comes the time of a new and capable German naval fleet, unburdened but effective, capable of swift defense and ready for the future!\n\nLet the world sneer at our rusting hulks: beneath the surface, the Serpent lies in wait."
GER_Invasion_fleet:0 "Invasion Fleet"
GER_Invasion_fleet_desc:0 "The course before us is clear: we cannot long afford to sustain this immense, draining naval buildup. While we have the upper hand in the European seas, we must prepare the Kriegsmarine for offensive operations - the emphasis here will be on quick strikes and overwhelming destruction, delivered so rapidly that the enemy will be ripe for our invasion.\n\nTo do this, sacrifices must be made: a little trimming of building standards will boost our naval buildup even further, and naval doctrinal innovations will be discouraged in favor of relevant planning strategies."
GER_Prepare_for_Sealion:0 "Prepare for Sealion"
GER_Prepare_for_Sealion_desc:0 "It is a blessing of history that we never had to put the abortive Operation Sealion into practice: the Luftwaffe was untested, our fleets were in many areas primitive and unready for shore defense, and our men were, to put it bluntly, utterly unproven. Not this time: we are ready for an actual fight on the shores of Britain.\n\nAs the ships steam out of their yards, as the airplanes buzz ever closer to the coast, as the Navy masses like an iron wave to right an old half-mistake: we are ready to finish where we left off, and we will make sure the Anglos know it."
GER_Naval_Frenzy:0 "Naval Frenzy"
GER_Naval_Frenzy_desc:0 "We have pumped so much into the German naval machine that it forms an integral part of our civilian industry: as ships are churned out month after month, the industry booms with the sound of tens of thousands of workers hammering the Reich's future into being. Why not take this energy and channel it into an economic bubble?\n\nWith a little guided speculation, we will make the industrialists rich, the naval buildup fully sustainable, and the Kriegsmarine as massive as it needs to be! Who cares about long-term affordability? We must look to the Golden Future!"

twrspeergoebbels.1.t:0 "The Kriegsmarine"
twrspeergoebbels.1.d:0 "The forces of the Kriegsmarine didn't pursue open combat with the British during the war, favouring starving the British Isles to break their will. With the British signing a peace treaty in 1941, the focus of the war became the Russian front and with that, token blockades were sent to the Baltic sea. Beyond that, the Kriegsmarine had little else to do to bring Germany victory.\n\nIn initial post-war years, it was deemed necessary for the Kriegsmarine to rival if not overshadow the British Navy and thus, expansion occurred. However, in recent years, it has proven not to be a worthwhile investment. The Americans, veterans of naval warfare from their war with the Japanese, have proven a far greater threat than the British and with their strength combined, Germany cannot match them at sea. So, the Kriegsmarine were left as they were, oversized, outdated and outmatched. This status quo cannot continue if the Reich is to remain dominant."
twrspeergoebbels.1.a:0 "Control the seas!"

twrspeergoebbels.2.t:0 "The Wehrmacht"
twrspeergoebbels.2.d:0 "The Wehrmacht, the infamous ground armies of the German Reich. The years have not been kind to them. It is no secret that during the European War, the forces of Germany were overstretched and at times, close to breaking point. That could not be more true than it was with the Wehrmacht. Through the initially successful Operation Barbarossa, The Russian Insurgency and the numerous scattered land campaigns against the British, French and other allies, the land armies of Germany were well-worn. Manpower shortages at the time were especially concerning. Reich propaganda at the time did it's job in hiding it but the Wehrmacht was a wounded, overworked wolf barely capable of fighting for much longer.\n\nIt is little wonder then, that today's Wehrmacht is so content to rest on its accomplishments. After the treaties that secured the Reich's future, the Wehrmacht was left to its own devices. With such effort expended in the war, the hierarchy, training and even discipline of our armies was left stagnant. The same generals, the same officers, the same training. The Wehrmacht fails to adapt to changing times, instead they leverage their greatest victories to excuse any lack of action."
twrspeergoebbels.2.a:0 "The army must change!"

twrspeergoebbels.3.t:0 "The Luftwaffe"
twrspeergoebbels.3.d:0 "The Luftwaffe never got their chance to confront the might of the British Empire over their airspace. But the Luftwaffe did see active duty during the Germans' push into the Soviet Union, covering the airspace, performing aerial bombings and providing important air support for the ground units.\n\nThe Soviet Air Force was no match for the might of our glorious Luftwaffe, but the years of arrogance have caused stagnation in the ranks. Pilots have received less and less trainings as their efficiency declined. While we might still hold some leverage against our enemies, the Luftwaffe is in some dire need of improvement, and must adapt quickly to stay ahead of the the Reich's enemies."

They were not informed about the speech's true intentions and were utterly shocked when two banners greeted them at the top of the stadium - Totaler Krieg.\nWhen these journalists attempted to leave in a panic, they were stopped by the guards, forced to mark every single word of Goebbels' speech.

Despite the use of elite German doctors, they have failed to cure Goebbels of his illnesses. But during his final days, Goebbels remained delusional and used his time to draft speeches, most of which he planned to use after his inevitable recovery.\n\nBut at last, few hours ago, Goebbels succumbed from a heart attack, dying at the age of 61. Not long after, the Government would make an official statement declaring his death to the German public, and transferred his body to an unknown location.\n\nCurrently, the situation in Germany remains grim, with the question of rather Germany should continue Dr.Goebbels' legacy and political doctrines up for fierce debate."

Albert Speer was promised high positions of power and a certain amount of influence under Goebbels' leadership, and Speer has proven himself to be an effective minister. However, he is regarded as a flawed individual with faulty concepts on National Socialism, holding beliefs that are the polar opposite of what Goebbels believes in.\n\nWhile Goebbels can indeed, uphold his promises, he can also ignore these promises and assign Speer to some unfavourable, minor position within the Reich."

Despite Maurice's status and relationship with Adolf Hitler, Goebbels disregarded all of these factors and issued an order to arrest Emil Maurice under the charges of 'Treason'.\n\nIn one of the most notable television event in Germany, Emil Maurice along other Honorary Aryans, such as Stephanie Julianne von Hohenlohe were placed in a collective trial, which the collective verdict was made, declaring that all Honorary Aryans have forfeited their right of survival.\n\nEmil Maurice was executed live on television, with many other leftover Japanese Nationals in Germany being 'expelled' to the Baltic Sea."

This meant a great amount of funds were provided to the Deutsche Zeichentrickfilme, allowing them to expand their operations with new, state of the art equipment and the ability to train new talents.\n\nHopefully, Deutsche Zeichentrickfilme can utilize these new resources to preach National Socialism to the youth and combine family entertainment with national values.

At times, these children's mind can be freely shaped by our authorities, making them the most loyal elements of the army if they were to be deployed.\n\nWith propaganda efforts and an extensive training programme, the concept of child soldiers are no longer a desperate measure, but a honourable act to serve the fatherland with utmost bravery, forming Germany's first professional Youth Panzergrenadier Divisions.

While technically not an attempt of forming a new religion, this style of Hitler worshipping more fanatical than the one seen during Hitler's regime can certainly be described as the Goebbels' very own 'non-religious religion of the Reich'."

While this treaty was already a facade to limit Catholic influence in Germany, Joseph Goebbels have taken this act one step further, proclaiming that the treaty that was signed by Franz von Papen with the 34 negotiated articles at the time are now invalid. Stating that \"The values of National Socialism and the will of the people demand the retraction of ancient, defuncted policies\", seemingly revoking the negotiated treaty to encourage political violence against the Catholics.\n\nWhile the Holy See has condemned Germany's actions, diplomatic ties are still active between the two."

These Gauleiters have been issued with an ultimatum, demanding their loyal cooperation in exchange for continuing their reign, or face the wrath of the Central Government with no further guarantee on their leadership's safety. As part of Albert Speer's trickery, the exchange between Albert Speer and the Gauleiter of Westphalia-South was deliberately leaked to other ministers, with Speer's aggressive and cold dialogues shattering any former speculations on his soft-spoken nature during the Hitler Era.\n\nWith this, Albert Speer has managed to establish a coalition for political stability.

Influential members of the government on a national and local level. The National Club meets in a unknown clubhouse twice a month, where matters on national level and party issues are addressed and handled.

All current and future government public projects will be contracted to this company, with material firms required to cooperate when the company requests.\n\nIn classic fashion, the board of directors for this company is made up of Speer's confidants and allies, but structured in a way where efficiency is ensured in the execution branch of the company. This vision is true to most local management positions with one exception, Albert Speer appointed his son, Albert Speer Junior as a secretary, whom has not even finished his education.

While Albert Speer might be able to put these existing definitions into government record, his reformist identity might enable him to enact some drastic changes to this border issue, cutting down on bureaucractic confusion and its related costs.

While this might be considered petty by some, this is just another way for Germans to express their supremacy over the Americans."

twrspeercities.2.d:0 "After the expansion of Germania, Albert Speer has announced his plans on expanding Hamburg as 'Versandstadt', the Capital of German Shipping. Albert Speer aimed to construct multiple enormous dockyards, with the goal of turning Hamburg into a 'national dockyard'.\n\nWhile these dockyards are designed for military purposes, Speer went an extra mile by handcrafting each dockyards' overall designs. All of these dockyards are designed in a stripped neoclassicism style, with multiple pillars and Nazi victory symbols filling empty spaces. Intriguingly, one of the dockyard's entrance will feature two sets of statues, with one being Adolf Hitler, and the other being a statue of Albert Speer."

twrspeercities.202.d:0 "Versandstadt is no longer merely a honorary city title, but is now a realized dream. Formerly known as Hamburg, Versandstadt serves to be the national dockyard and shipping hub of the Greater German Reich. With a shipping capacity unmatched throughout the world, Versandstadt is the biggest port city in the world.\n\nWhile it might be questionable on rather Versandstadt's shipping needs would ever reach near it's capacity, Albert Speer rebuked such doubts by claiming it's value in a future situation, calling himself 'the Architect with Foresight'. Nonetheless, Hitler and Speer's statues stare proudly onto the docks of former Hamburg, a constant reminder for these workers about the Führer's divine glory over Greater Germany."

twrspeercities.3.d:0 "Until the passing of the Führer, his concept of Führermuseum was never truly realized. But with an architect at the helm, Speer has finally finished the Führermuseum project, with all types of Nazi endorsed art pieces being displayed for public viewing, wishing to turn the Führer's hometown, Linz into a cultural capital of Europe. In addition, Speer adjusted this Führermuseum with a mausoleum of Hitler's parents, and the Führer himself.\n\nDue to fact that the public can only witness Hitler's coffin behind a glass chamber, some speculate that the chamber hosts an empty coffin, with the Führer's whereabouts unknown to the people of Germany."

twrspeercities.4.d:0 "Due to Munich's special status within the Reich, it was awarded two honorary titles by the Führer himself. Known for it's significance on German arts and the birth of National Socialism, Albert Speer has ordered the a complete renovation of Munich, hoping to turn it into a masterfully crafted model city.\n\nOne of the highlights of this project decreed by Speer includes a grand sculpture, depicting the martyrs of the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, sacrificing themselves to the Blood Flag. Speer also planned to have each and everyone of the martyrs' biographies carved onto the foundations of this grand sculpture, as a way to remind Germans about their past struggles before achieving National Socialism."

twrspeercities.5.d:0 "Friedrich Pabst crafted a plan to reshape Warschau into a ideal German city. This plan was ignored by the Hitler Administration, and did not see any progress during his reign. But with Albert Speer as the leader of Germany, the Pabst Plan is finally being realized under Albert Speer's personal directive. Crews of unpaid slave workers and soldiers are now demolishing this old Polish city, trying to replace it with an Aryan city.\n\nUnder the objectives of Pabst Plan, majority of the Polish built neighbourhoods are planned to be completely removed, with all of the local non-Aryan residents expelled from Warschau. A large Parteivolkshalle is to replace the Royal Castle, serving as a major transportation hub of the Greater Reich."

Deutsches Stadion's design was inspired by the Panathenaic Stadium of Athens, built in a similar style but with a sense of stripped neoclassicism sprinkled around the design. This Stadium has the capacity to hold 405,000 spectators, with five tiers of seats that are fitted with lifts.\n\nAs part of the opening ceremony, Albert Speer witnessed the stadium's first ever event, utilizing Germany's elite groups of soldiers and athletes to organize a grand 'chariot fencing' tournament. In the end, Albert Speer congratulated the winners on a special platform, then made a speech in front crowds and crowds of spectators, calling this stadium 'A new chapter to Germany'.\n\nAfter the ending ceremony, 16 spectators were trampled to death upon exiting."

twrspeercities.7.d:0 "Supported by the Kriegsmarine and by Adolf Hitler himself, Nordstern was planned to become the 'German Singapore', with a heavy focus on naval matters and trade. Despite being a metropolis, Nordstern functions like a naval base with a sizable population, it's sole goal is to function as the gateway to North Atlantic.\n\nSituated near Trondheim, Nordstern was put on hold when Germany's economy stagnated, and was finally completed after Albert Speer issued orders to resume the plans. Packed with around 300,000 German settlers, Nordstern's future is bright, and will play a vital role in Germany's control over the Atlantic."

twrgermany.48.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events the Fatherland has requested our immediate subjugation and reintegration into the Reich, Germania has deemed our regime too unstable for self-governance to be considered a viable option and has given us an ultimatum that if no decision is made the army will cross the border and "liberate" the Reichskommissariat. Though many in the administration are not agreeing to the demand as "treason of the highest order" there is a minority in the administration who think these actions are harsh and consider secession as an alternative, this has led the Reichskommisar to call an emergency meeting where after hours of debate the doors of the hall were opened and the words which came out of the Reichskommisar's mouth were: "We shall therefore…""

This has made the government fervent as this recent victory has left their mouth sweet for more victories  as the top brass and army cheer the soldiers on. But some members point out that with our entry violence against Germans has increased shockingly but these worries have been quieted by the cheers as another Reichskommissariat joins the Reich.

Ultimately, increasing the efficiency of German Eastern Europe."
