twrPolishHomeArmy.1.t:0 "폴란드가 무기를 요청하다"
twrPolishHomeArmy.1.d:0 "We have received a disturbing telegram from partisan forces operating within German-occupied Poland. Having been relayed through the Romanian embassy, the letter has become slightly soiled and crumpled; however the message is clear. "In the best interest of all freedom-loving men of the world, it is imperative that your government cooperate with the Romanian government and the exiled Polish government to bring an end to the nazi tyranny that's unceremoniously raped the Polish people for over a decade. We are willing to take out a loan on British-made firearms and basic combat equipment to assist us in this noble fight. \n\n- Regards, Witold Pilecki" \n\nWhile it would be beneficial to undermine the Nazis by any means necessary, it would be unwise to trigger a diplomatic incident or even a war over Poland again."
twrPolishHomeArmy.1.a:0 "폴란드는 원하는 모든 것을 받을 것이다."
twrPolishHomeArmy.1.b:0 "We can't afford a confrontation with Germany, the Home Army is on their own."
twrPolishHomeArmy.2.t:0 "영국이 수락하다!"
twrPolishHomeArmy.2.d:0 "Our connections to the British Foreign Office appear to have paid off, and the Brits have agreed to send us much-needed equipment in our noble insurrection against the German occupation."
twrPolishHomeArmy.2.a:0 "영국 동포들을 위해 건배!"
twrPolishHomeArmy.3.t:0 "영국이 거부하다!"
twrPolishHomeArmy.3.d:0 "We've received a diplomatic cable from the British Prime Minister's office, and none of it appears to be good news. Citing the increasing strain in Anglo-German relations, the UK will be unable to provide us with the equipment needed to end the German occupation. It would seem Poland may once again be alone."
twrPolishHomeArmy.3.a:0 "1939년의 배신과 같이, 지금도 배신했다!"
twrPolishHomeArmy.4.t:0 "폴란드가 요원을 요청하다"
twrPolishHomeArmy.4.d:0 "Another request from the Home Army operating in Poland has been received. This time the request concerns not the M.O.D, but MI6. The message contains the following: \n\n‘If the United Kingdom, who may I remind you are still our nominal allies, wishes to free the Polish people from the tyranny and torture of the German monster, it is imperitive that Home Army forces receive the finest advisors, attaches and other men and women of special skills to assist in the fight for European freedom. If this is not done, you risk damning the Polish people to destruction and the eternal domination of Europe by the Nazi menace. \"Zagloba\", \n\n-Home Army, Radosław Group. \n\nWhile directly sending British men and women to the Home Army may just tip the balance in their favour strategically, there is also a high risk. If the German's were to catch British citizens assisting Polish freedom fighters, it could cause a diplomatic incident of calamitous proportions."
twrPolishHomeArmy.4.a:0 "The Polish shall receive all they need, begin debriefing all operatives who can speak German and Polish."
twrPolishHomeArmy.4.b:0 "The risk is too great for too little reward. Perhaps we may discuss the issue at a later date, when the time is right. Best we burn these letters..."
twrPolishHomeArmy.5.t:0 "영국 요원"
twrPolishHomeArmy.5.d:0 "The letter arrived in the dark of the night. It was smuggled across the Romanian border by a lone British agent and through the charred remnants of the once beautiful fields and hills of Poland. Deep within the depths of the starved and withered city of Warsaw, the top leaders of the Home Army listen carefully as the much awaited reply from the United Kingdom is read aloud. It reads the following "Shadow operations within Poland, approved. Expect first observers and advisors by air. Further details to follow. Burn upon viewing. Signed, I.F." The leaders look to each other, all with the same thought. Hope at last."
twrPolishHomeArmy.5.a:0 "그들은 1939년과 같은 일을 저지를 수도 있었다..."
twrPolishHomeArmy.6.t:0 "지원은 없다"
twrPolishHomeArmy.6.d:0 "The letter arrived in the middle of a hot day. Passed along at the Romanian border, a lone Home Army operative traversed the dangerous route back to Warsaw to deliver his message. Once assembled the leaders of the Home Army listen tensely as the much awaited reply from the United Kingdom is read aloud. "the issue of operations within Poland is being discussed. Signed B.R". The room is silent."
twrPolishHomeArmy.6.a:0 "한 번 믿을 수 없는 동맹은, 영원히 믿을 수 없다!"
twrPolishHomeArmy.7.t:0 "한번 더 자유를!"
twrPolishHomeArmy.7.d:0 "Poles are used to occupation. For over 120 years, the Polish nation lay occupied, divided up by the three European powers of Prussia, Austria and Russia. Independence would be won after the Great War, but in a cruel twist of fate, the Germans and Russians would return to once again split the young Polish Republic between themselves. \n\nWith the Nazis soon victorious over the Soviets, the Polish people suffered perhaps one of the most brutal occupations of any nation in history. Massacres were commonplace, and millions of Polish men, women and children died at the hands of Nazi brutality. Every effort was made by the German authorities to erase the memory of the Polish nation through force, even more thoroughly than they had attempted to do over a century before. \n\nYet even then, the spirit of Poland survived, underground, resisting stronger against each brutal reprisal, preparing, waiting for the time when their freedom could again be won. The inevitable collapse of the German monster gave the opportunity for liberation, and the Polish people, with the help of allies, have against all odds thrown off the Nazi jackboot and retaken our nation. Twice battered, but never beaten, the Polish nation is free again."
twrPolishHomeArmy.7.a:0 "폴란드는 절대 죽지 않는다"
twrPolishHomeArmy.71.t:0 "진창인 미래"
twrPolishHomeArmy.71.d:0 "The clock struck twelve that fated day, rays of sunlight sneaking in through the cracks in the curtains, outside everything silent not even a gust of wind. Inside the solemn shouts of two men who had been drinking since the early morning. \n\nBoth were partisans, not of the resistance per say but their own little war. Starting with a drunk german that ran into them in the deep of night almost a decade ago now, and whom they had buried shortly after -bereft of all his bling - in the midst of the woods. It had continued with more germans vanishing, lost crates of goods, lost classified papers, kidnapping of some SS officers kid, burglary. They had made quite the profit off all those illicit goods and once the actual resistance got wind of them they made even more. \n\n"So what are we gon' do now tis all over?" Balik, the younger of the two asked. "We just gotta find somethin' new to make a quick buck" Janosik, the older slurred. "But-" "Don't inderrup' me, I'm sayin' glorious Poland sits at the crossroa' of empires in europe. Even with Hun cocksuckers beaten, they'll will prolly come back, ya get me?" "Of course" the youngers eyes lit up. "Even with those Toronto fuckers courting us, there's no guarantee they won't come back, ya hear?" "But what will we do in the meantime, for now they are bea-" He was once more interrupted by the cracking of the radio besides them. "Looks like the grand marshal is gonna proclaim us free, eh?" \n\nAnd the grand marshal did, he talked of polish greatness and how this is a victory unprecedented in human history and they are gonna have murals of the brave polish martyrs for a thousand years to come. Okay, maybe not that last part but it was all very proper and sure to raise the polish peoples spirit even higher than it already were. \n\nThat's at least what Balik would tell Janosik later as he had promptly passed on the table before the grand marshal could say anything. As Janosik opened his eyes in the evening of the same day again, Balik's set of yellow teeth greeted him, "you kno' Ive just got the brightest lil' idea as to where we should go next...""
twrPolishHomeArmy.71.a:0 "...the Russians seem to have got their shit together again in recent years..."
twrPolishHomeArmy.8.t:0 "군사정부의 지도자"
twrPolishHomeArmy.8.d:0 "With preparations for the national uprising well under way, some of our commanders have begun to question our leaders based in London. Much of this is targeted at our nominal commander, General Inspector of the Armed Forces: Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski. Having left Poland for London following the conclusion of hostilities in Europe, a number of our local commanders feel that Komorowski has lost touch with the suffering of the Polish people. Some have also noted their concerns over Komorowski's somewhat right-wing and anti-semetic politics, which have isolated many potential allies from Jewish and socialist resistance circles. They have suggested that Komorowski be ousted as Commander-In-Chief, and a new local council of resistance leaders be formed to lead our forces from the front. \n\nHowever, it is true that Komorowski holds in his palm many influential friends in London. These contacts could prove vital to attaining a wider array of funding and weaponry. Deposing Komorowski also runs the risk of angering our own Government-in-Exile. It may be wise, for the greater good, to allow Komorowski to continue his command of the Home Army."
twrPolishHomeArmy.8.a:0 "Good old Bór-Komorowski and the British shall lead us to victory."
twrPolishHomeArmy.8.b:0 "It is time for a change of leadership, we shall take direct command."

twrPoland.1.t:0 "망명정부의 귀환"
twrPoland.1.d:0 "Sikorski had waited decades. When the Nazi war machine consumed his homeland, he didn't lose hope, training soldiers in exile to fight against the Axis elsewhere. When the war was over, he didn't lose hope, continuing to help gather support and supplies for the resistance within Poland where he could. He propogated the war for freedom throughout the free world for another decade, even when no one would listen. Now Poland is in the hands of its own people once more and Sikorski's hope was proven valid and righteous, the world stays silent. No one mocks, no one dares to praise. They are stunned that the voice of the Poles was not eternally silenced by the Reich, and now it returns - laying bare the horrid sins that they have all wrought upon the peoples of Poland and of the Slavic lands. \n\nSikorski looked from side to side in disgust as he walked towards his plane, seeing yesman after yesman and political beggars hoping to drag some favour from the new head-honcho of Poland. As if the iron-cast will of the people could be manipulated into serving bureaucratic purposes once again. It disgusted Sikorski to his very core, and this mass of politicians and parliamentarians, journalists and pseudo-philosophers reminded him of the issues of democracy. Could the will of the Polish people be carried out if it was weighed down by individual interests? He shook off this thought for now, his mind set on returning to Poland and rebuilding his nation from ruin. \n\nOn the plane home, the voices speaking to him became a blur. He couldn't get the thought that democracy itself was what dragged Poland into being weak enough to be consumed by the early Nazi war machine out of his head, playing devil's advocate only to combat the idea - a trial of the mind. Nonetheless, when his plane landed, the twenty-five years of hard work all seemed to pay off, as the cheering crowds and scorched buildings dragged his mind back to reality. No matter what came next, Poland was free - and now, a hero returned, his hand pleaded with to guide Poland's scarred nation back to glory."
twrPoland.1.a:0 "폴란드인들은 이미 마음을 정했다."
twrPoland.1.b:0 "폴란드는 폭군을 끝장냈다!"
twrPoland.2.t:0 "선거 준비"
twrPoland.2.d:0 "The weeks of work and dedication in rebuilding the Polish nation were interceded by the thoughts of the future of democracy within the nation - and the more that Sikorski laid his mind to it, the more he realised that it was not his place to decide where Poland shall go from here. He was not like those who would grab power for themselves as western politicians do - and because he wished to uphold his principles and the will of the people, he could no longer hold his emergency powers with any true justification - at least, in his mind. \n\n"As much as I dedicate myself to carrying out the will of the people... I am not the Polish people. I am not all of you, and I cannot continue to justify my control over the Polish nation while I remain unelected. We are free and safe at last, not because of the nations of the West, not because of some fluke, but because of Polish blood, Polish ingenuity, Polish weapons and the Polish people. You all sacrificed something for this nation to be free - and free it shall be." \n\nShuffling of papers could be heard, before, at last, Sikorski spoke his last sentence for the radio and TV broadcast. "You, the people, represent the strength of the Bison that roams our lands - you, with all your strength and your will to protect this nation, will decide your new leader in one month's time. God bless you all." The broadcast ended there and then - Poland's fate forever changed."
twrPoland.2.a:0 "Omnia Pro Patria!"
twrPoland.3.t:0 "폴란드 선거"
twrPoland.3.d:0 "The first thing foreign dignitaries notice is the deafening color scheme. The Polish flag is fairly simple when flown at state occasions, but festooned across the Election Day posters and flown from window to window, it takes on the intensity of a soundless roar. The growl echoes all through Poland, in small towns filled with veterans of the Independence struggle, and all the way to the capital itself it resounds with every yell to vote. \n\nIn excitement confusion is bred: the men and women of the PSL march in impromptu worker's solidarity brigades across the lower-middle class districts of North Warsaw, yelling the name Mikolajczyk like a choir boy in his first rehearsal. To underline their point they carry free bread, giving it out to the beggars and orphans who cluster in the old Ghetto - and they nearly come to blows with waifs who have taken to giving out SN propaganda about the Church's role in society. \n\nElsewhere common enemies are found. Jankowski himself, in a meeting with industrialists and unionist leaders, nearly falls into an altercation with two incensed union workers over the role of independent unionism - and then a third voice speaks about the Enlightened State, with the Church as a moral authority over both. There is a moment of baffled silence, and then Jankowski and the Unionists explode into argument with the SN sympathizer. It takes the intervention of the police to calm the scuffle down. \n\nArguments, old, old arguments, echo in worn-down apartments about the Church, democracy and the Polish dream's contours. But as the votes are counted, one by one, it becomes evident that one visionary has triumphed over his compatriots. The future, in Poland, happens not until it happens all at once. And the helmsman of that vision swims into view."
twrPoland.3.a:0 "The PSL and Mikolajczyk shall bring power to the people!"
twrPoland.3.b:0 "Jankowski, the great negotiator - his NPR shall bring unity!"
twrPoland.3.c:0 "Bielecki and the SN shall guide us through tradition!"
twrPoland.4.t:0 "호의에 보답하다"
twrPoland.4.d:0 "The British ambassador to Poland stepped out of his plane in Warsaw to cheering crowds. The city, even from this specifically chosen spot, bore the scars of the German bombing campaign during the rebellion. Nonetheless, the beaming faces of the crowds and the bustling atmosphere of the fine city showed the resolve of the Polish people. He smiled to himself, walking down the path laid out for him, greeting the crowds in quick fashion before making his way onwards towards the Polish head of state, Wladyslaw Sikorski. In front of multiple news cameras, they both smiled and shook hands, making various displays of friendship before they both entered a limousine and began travelling towards the residence of Sikorski. \n\nShaking hands the ambassador sat back and slightly relaxed, now someone obscured from the public eye by the mildly tinted windows. "Greetings, Prime Minister." His translater spoke, and Sikorski mildly relaxed in turn, shaking the ambassadors' hand. The ambassador spoke up again. "It's a pleasure to finally meet you in person. You know that they're calling you the 'Polish Caesar' back in Britain, right?" Sikorski precautioned himself, not falling for any attempts at charm, but kept up his manners. "I'm flattered, sir." They stayed silent, watching the streets to their sides. Sikorski waved his hand every few seconds by passers by, everyone seemed to be filled with goodwill not seen in many wartorn nations as they chased after the car once able to discern his face through the tinted windows. \n\nAs they finally rounded to his residence, exiting the car and walking to meet a prompted crowd of reporters and radio microphones, Sikorski spoke his last few sentences. "Britain was once condemned by every Pole worth his soul. Twenty years ago, all we saw was a nation that turned its back on its promises and left our people to die on this godforsaken continent. And yet, despite your losses, your efforts and sacrifices - you, just as we, did not lose hope." He turned and nodded in respect to the ambassador, before continuing. "When the Polish nation cried out once again from the depths, the atoning sons of God in the West reached out to atone for their past mistakes. True good has arisen like a phoenix fresh of flame, and with our fates tied once more, so it shall stay." \n\nAnd with that, Europe was whole once more."
twrPoland.4.a:0 "호의에 보답하다"
twrPoland.5.t:0 "Democracy - unbowed, unbent, unbroken."
twrPoland.5.d:0 "Warsaw. Renamed from its German misappropriation following the righteous liberation of its streets early imadmenn the conflict against the Nazi occupiers, it now stands once again as the capital of the revived Polish state. Its buildings may be damaged and its streets charred with the remnants of Luftwaffe firebombs, but it is Polish once again. \n\n"And that -" Sikorski swung around to face all of the representatives of the Polish nation, swiftly bringing what attention may not have been on him straight back to focus. "That is why we cannot ally ourselves with this so-called alliance of 'free nations', the Toronto Accord. What do they know of the value of freedom? When we bled for every bit of land we retook from the German oppressors, they did not send guns, men nor advisors - they laid back on their ships in the English Channel as they did twenty years ago and lied to our faces, saying support will come." \n\nSilence filled the room. The Sejm members leaned in, almost entranced by the speech Sikorski was putting on. "But you do not fool a Polish man twice!" The room erupted into a chorus of cheers almost immediately. If it wasn't known that Sikorski was the most popular man in Poland, you'd think it was a prime example of a dictatorial cult of personality. "We stand, rebuilding OUR streets, OUR buildings, with OUR men and OUR might! Poland shall not be the slave of the West as long as I draw breath... Poland is not yet lost, nor shall it ever be!" He sat down, clearly out of breath - but the clapping and cheers continued - not just in the temporary Sejm building, but as the radio address echoed through the streets, so did the nation."
twrPoland.5.a:0 "Three centuries in the making, Poland's chains are undone."
twrPoland.6.t:0 "독일 정착민 문제"
twrPoland.6.d:0 "Germans have never been strangers to Polish soil, but this last wave of settlement has been most troublesome. Years of so-called Germanisation have left unquestionable scars on the Polish nation, both physically and spiritually. Many of our compatriots are calling for their immediate deportation from the newly restored Polish republic, seeing it as an answer to the generation of colonial oppression which we have had to endure. Others are not so keen on expulsion, however. The German settlers were the only group of people with real access to capital and education during the occupation, and expelling the settlers without any kind of expropriation may leave Poland weaker and poorer than it has to be. \n\nWill the Germans be deported back to Germany, saving us the societal pressure but forging their general expertise? Will we attempt to keep them in our new republic, knowing the ethnic tensions that decision will exacerbate? Now is the time to decide."
twrPoland.6.a:0 "Germania Delenda Est!"
twrPoland.6.b:0 "The Germans can stay, under a very tight leash."
twrPoland.7.t:0 "부역자 문제"
twrPoland.7.d:0 "Moving past the nightmare that was the Nazis and the General Government will be a difficult process for our nation. One issue which is proving divisive are those accused of collaborating with the Germans. Much of the administration of the General Government was performed by Poles. Poles also served with General Government security forces, and even in the Wehrmacht. Some Poles have even assisted the hated Gestapo. Perhaps in the name of honour and national stability it would be best to put these men and women on trial for treason. \n\nHowever some in our government have stressed the need to not start a witch hunt in Poland. They feel Poland has seen enough blood spilled on its soil, and some of the acts committed by Home Army troops against supposed \"collaborators\", without trial, has raised cause for concern. Many involved in the General Government were simply trying to make a living. Also the potential brain drain within our administration from hunting every man and woman who worked for a German may cripple our ability to govern."

twrPoland.8.t:0 "시코르스키의 대숙청"
twrPoland.8.d:0 "In a seemingly unprecedented move, Wladyslaw Sikorski has decided to keep his dictatorial powers under the pretext of preserving an 'orderly and structured' reconstruction of the Polish state. Unsurprisingly, this move has generated immense opposition from across the political spectrum who were hoping for a restoration of democratic law. Presented with these clear-opponents to the Iron Hussar's absolute rule, Sikorski and his cabinet have decided to utilize loyal elements of the police to crack down on these 'anti-government dissidents'. But how far should this purge go?"
twrPoland.8.a:0 "Arrest the opposition leaders;"
twrPoland.8.b:0 "Anyone involved in anti-government activities will be dealt with!"

twrPoland.9.t:0 "루블린 파업!"
twrPoland.9.d:0 "At precisely 4:30 PM in the war-torn city of Lublin, the formerly-exiled communist labour agitator Boleslaw Bierut arrived in his hometown of Lublin for the first time since 1939 to a country in crisis. As the police under the aspiring dictator Wladyslaw Sikorski were tasked with removing all sources of opposition to his rule, the trade unions were prime targets. Calling for an immediate general strike across Poland, Bierut has gathered his closest supporters and ordered a march from Lublin to Warsaw in the hopes of pressuring Sikorski to resign in favour of a reorganized government run by devoted Marxists. As Bierut's communists march into the capital in what looks like an attempted putsch, the army in Warsaw..."

twrPoland.9.b:0 "Joins the communists and forces Sikorski's resignation!"
twrPoland.10.t:0 "미치광이들의 시대"
twrPoland.10.d:0 "Poland, the heart of Europe - Warsaw, the heart of Poland. How fitting that a city so central should pulse with violent passion. How fitting that its streets now boil with the red of flags and raging mobs, that the surge of the crowd should draw masses into its squares and call forth deafening howls that almost - almost - drown out the gunfire, sporadic, like old beer-barrels popping off. \n\nIt seems almost operatic, Wagnerian. Screaming masses tear down flags across the old Sejm building, and the acrid smell of synthetic fabric drifts across the streets. Torches make their way from hand to hand to the frontage of the old courtyard, where they are tossed into a burning pile of red-white cloth. People surge forward, tearing down everything they can see of the old regime as People's Commissars egg them on. Violence is in their eyes. Violence is in the air. The heart of Poland cries for blood, and it will not be denied. \n\nA stone eagle's face splinters and cracks as the hammer is brought to it, again and again, a hypnotic rhythm that ends as the head snaps right off the body. Snarls melt into yells as new portraits are hung from the gaping wound of the neck, Stalin and a new face - some call him Mao, speaking with almost religious reverence - splayed onto wooden frames. A cry - the new order has risen! - echoes through the courtyard. There is a moment of dead silence from the crowd. Then it surges forward, bringing the new world about by tearing apart the old. \n\nAs the Sejm gutters with smoke and flame, the crowds part to make way for one last spectacle, Sikorski and his party of Democrats, shackled and ragged, walking slowly into the centre of history. One last march to the frame of death. He stares at the Warsaw he so loved, its smokestacks now jostling with pillars of belching flame, Warsaw the heart of Poland. A heart turned upside down."

twrPoland.11.d:0 "As the new government of the people convenes from the pockmarked and bullet-riddled Sejm, the wretched elements of Sikorski's regime thwarted by our might, the question on the minds of members of our new party is that of a chairman. In the wake of our socialist government's formation, two camps have cropped up - those supporting comrade Bolesław Bierut, a committed Stalinist who'd spent his time in the Union whilst Poland was shuttered beneath darkness, and Kazimierz Mijal, a former ally of Bierut turned fierce rival, who follows more Maoist doctrines of socialism, while simultaneously decrying supporters of Bierut's faction as "revisionists" and "too radicalized". \n\nRegardless, fellow party comrades must make a choice upon the next batch of elections - And the fate of our new government of the people hangs on with it."

twrPoland.12.d:0 "Poland, home of a people who've been painfully tortured and oppressed by the Nazi regime, a land left in shambles of its former self, subject to aryan colonisation, brutal suppression and never ending persecution of "undesirables", is finally free...Or so it would seem. \n\nJust today, at the Sejm, The Central Committee held trials against the the patriots of the Polish Home Army, the socialists of the PSL, nationalists of the SN, right wingers of the SP and numerous other factions, all of which have been trialed on many different grounds,such as sabotage and conspiring with the enemy, but all have been recognised to have committed "High Treason Against The People's Revolution". \n\nIn a view reminiscent of the infamous Reign Of Terror from The French Revolution, countless have been sentenced to death and sent to the guillotine, those who haven't, facing an arguably worse fate- the labour camps. Only a few have been aquitted, most having socialist ties or backgrounds. \n\nAfter these trials the new regime has secured Poland, bringing it under the reign of the proletariat. For better or worse, Poland is now born anew."
twrPoland.12.a:0 "Robespierre would be proud..."
twrPoland.13.t:0 "시코르스키의 망명"
twrPoland.13.d:0 "In the halls of the Sejm there is a deep and brooding silence. It is the silence of men who know that they are in a race against time. There are few options available to them, and for entirely understandable reasons - if the Roman Senate failed, in the end, to deal with their Caesar, the odds are not looking good for the Polish Sejm with their own popular war-hero. Even so, the Sejm must try. \n\nAttempts at paying the Democrat off with a sum of money and an expensive estate somewhere are disposed of almost immediately. Sikorski has never been one to take bribes, and the man is far too public to risk the possibility of a leak to the press. Certainly the regime is not particularly predisposed to granting Sikorski's group a place in Parliament, for the general is as outspoken and brash as he has always been - he is a living, breathing threat to regime legitimacy. The Sejm argues and contends into the late hours, but in the end there is only really one choice. \n\nThe charges of collaboration are not difficult to secure: circumstantial evidence is, while flimsy in places, a wholly sufficient charge to forever mar Sikorski's reputation. The Soviets, while long gone, are not soon forgotten for their brutality - and the news, when it spreads, hits with savage effect. Colleges and businesses deny their complicity, and the nation turns its gaze from the war-hero in an effort to spare itself. \n\nSikorski himself waits in a padded cell, as luxurious as any one can find in Poland these days. He is often lost in imagined pasts and vanished futures - the could-have-beens of Poland, and the opportunities it has lost. A sorrow best left to the evening air, and yet something of its essence seems stuck between his ribs. An old man, clutching at what cannot be held with firm hands as he slips away. \n\nWhen the order of permanent exile comes, Sikorski takes his meager possessions and begins to walk into rural Poland, shambling from place to place, a man already dead. He will never return to Warsaw, or to prominence, again."

Amidst the congratulations of international observers, amidst the quiet unravelling of the last loyalist militias, an impossible hope realizes itself. \n\nExperts continue to worry about resurgent political factionalism, but there is cause for hope: all parties have sworn loyalty to the New Constitution upon assuming office. Regardless of the results, Poland is already the clear victor, emerging from the depths of despotism for what might yet prove the last time."

Stanislaw_description:0 "Leader of the PSL (Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe) and former deputy prime minister of Władyslaw Sikorski, Mikołajczyk is a strong advocate of the democratic system, radical land reform and establishing definitive borders for the Polish state; especially in the eastern borderlands."
Bielecki_desc:0 "Leader of the SN (Stronnictwo Narodowe) and originally the secretary of legendary Polish nationalist Roman Dmowski, Bielecki is a firm believer in the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Polish society. Taking Francoist Spain as his model, his desire is that of a democratically enlightened state where national catholicism is official policy. He is also known to admire Portugal's Salazar and it wouldn't be unheard of for him to advocate for a form of corporatism. "
Jankowski_Desc:0 "Co-Founder of the pre-war NPR (Narodowa Partia Robotnicza), Jankowski subscribes to the ideas of corporatist solidarism. This is not to be confused with typical fascist corporatism however, as he believes in reforming the capitalist system to better accommodate the relations between trade unions and employers, which also makes it distinct from Marxist theories."

But deep inside we all know the truth, Sikorski did not give up his power because he wanted to. If he had his way his face would be plastered on every wall, becoming just another tin-pot ruler to add to our sadly long list. Steps must be taken to ensure Sikorski is never put in a position of real power again. An \"offer\" of early retirement should do the trick.

ZAP_A_Union_of_Liberated_Brothers_desc:0 "Alas, Poland and Czechia, once nothing more than mere slaves to the Greater German Reich, deemed as subhumans, inferior beings whose only purpose consisted of being tools to our oppressors, are free once more. Free from the tyranny of those who took everything from us, freed by those who have given us everything we now have. Our brotherhood of western slavic nations has been restored, but not under the name of Czechia or Poland, for we are Zapadoslavia, the guardian of the slavs."

ZAP_Slovensko_the_Two_Faced_Brother_desc:0 "Shunned by those who were once their brothers, having betrayed the ones which trusted them the most. In March 1939 the Slovak Republic declared their independence from Czechoslovakia under the leadership of Jozef Tiso, the leader of the Slovak People's Party, who offered his services to the German Reich. With that, Slovakia betrayed their Czechs brothers, leaving them to their grim fate under the harsh German occupation. Though they have betrayed our ideals and are to be done away with in the views of many, there is still a chance for redemption. Not all Slovaks blindly followed their leader and resisted in the underground for years, inciting strikes and rebellions, to free the Slovakian land of the tyranny that befell it. We shall give them their chance, the chance to once again do the right thing and fight for the future of the western slavs, and we shall save them for their damnation by bringing them back into the light of freedom and democratic values."

The members of the Slovak People's Party and the Slovak Armed Forces shall be brought to justice for their inhuman crimes and for their oppression of the Slovak spirit. The fascists shall perish, once and for all!"

ZAP_Zapadoslavian_Collective_Farm_desc:0 "The Agricultural development of Slovakia, Czechia and Poland has been all but hindered by the Germans, who enslaved them to work in factories or send them away from their plentiful homes, which were producing the food for the local population. Instead handing these very farms to German settlers and leaving our people to starve in the dirt, with no regard or remorse for what would happen to us. Now that we have established control over the country the time has come for major reforms, to have giant farms to keep a steady food supply, which shall be directly supervised by the central government. No more shall our people starve, no longer shall they feel hunger, for we offer them; Peace, Land & Bread."

Because of that we could potentially use Slovakia to deal with the collaborators, and at the same time as a unifying symbol to our new fatherland, as the brother who finally came home where their true loyalties lay. Slovakia, free once more, the compromiser of the east."
