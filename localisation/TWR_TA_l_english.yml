    twrta.6.d:0 "After some discussion, all the member nations of the Toronto Accord Council have voted unanimously for immediate intervention in the German Civil War."
    twrta.6.a:0 "To war!"
    twrta.7.t:0 "Toronto Accord Does not Intervene"
    twrta.7.d:0 "Though some parties supported immediate intervention, others were opposed, and a general agreement could not be met, and the meeting has ended without the Council deciding to intervene immediately. Instead, the Accord has adopted a policy of preparation and mobilisation, and future intervention or war in this tense time is still likely."

    twrta.8.t:0 "Reviving Plan R 4"
    twrta.8.d:0 "With direct intervention in Germany having been rejected by the Toronto Accord's members for the time being, British officials have come up with a smaller proposal for an intervention of sorts, using old plans from the war of 1939-1940. Sweden was a vital source of iron for Germany, needed for its economy and war effort, and a plan was devised to invade Norway preemtively and cut off the supply. This was foiled with Germany's own invasion of Norway, but with the Nazi state now having collapsed into civil war, they are unable to hold onto their Norwegian puppet state. The old plan, known as Plan R 4, could be revived, updated, and put into action, providing allied forces with a northern base with which to perform further operations as well as cutting off Germany's iron ore supply. \n\nAmerican backing is seen as being needed for this operation, shall we propose it to the United States?"
    twrta.8.a:0 "Send the plan to Washington"

    twrta.104.d:0 "With communications lost, and our reconaissance aircraft having failed to return to its base, we can only assume it was lost, and most likely shot down, over German airspace. Some of our more confident and hawkish officials are pushing for retaliatory airstrikes across Germany, while others fear the risk of all out war when we're not ready. How should we respond, Mr. President?"

    twrta.15.t:0 "American Retaliatory Strikes"
    twrta.15.d:0 "Following reports of the shooting down of a US spy plane over German territory, the US air force has launched widespread retaliatory strikes across Germany, hitting military and industrial targets held by all of the civil war factions. It is clear that the Americans are spoiling for war. While we could retaliate unilaterally, launching our available missiles and aircraft against Toronto Accord military assets in Britain and the North Sea, doing so would virtually ensure all-out war, and a full-scale intervention of the Toronto Accord. How should we proceed?"
    twrta.15.a:0 "Stand down"

    twrta.12.t:0 "Outbreak of War"
    twrta.12.d:0 "In response to our air strikes, German forces have begun launching strikes against our military positions in Europe.
