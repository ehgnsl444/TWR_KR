 TWR_HOL.1.t:0 "Indonesian Revolution"
 TWR_HOL.1.d:0 "Indonesian revolutionaries have rose up in revolt against the Confederal Government. Strategic reports suggest that half of Java Island has gone over to the revolution, with a self-proclaimed "Indonesia" being the "national government". An emergency government session has been held, generals in the Royal Army report that Dutch forces are greatly outnumbered, and the government will be evacuated from the East Indies entirely. Also, the Dutch royalty has been evacuated to nearby Singapore after the first signs of revolution reached Batavia."
 TWR_HOL.1.a:0 "Wahr di buer, die garde kumt!"
 TWR_HOL.1.b:0 "For Indonesia!"

 TWR_HOL.1000.t:0 "New Wave of Riots"
 TWR_HOL.1000.d:0 "Since Sukarno's arrest in 1949 for collaborating with the Japanese aggressors, Indonesian activists were outraged. Since then, frequent riots have occurred monthly, each time the Dutch used greater and greater force to suppress any dissent. Thankfully, our Indonesian social elite collaborators have always tried to calm the rioters down by promising the rioters that Sukarno is safe and well-treated.\n\nOur government have made token promises to the Indonesian public to somewhat effective results. But all of our efforts would go to waste when information regarding Sukarno's inadequate imprisonment in Suriname and documents on a possible secret trial were leaked to the public. This has sparked incredible outrage, where demonstrations turned bloody when an unknown source fired at our military police, resulting in full retaliation by Dutch forces.\n\nFormations are now being relocated in an attempt to put an end to this unrest."
 TWR_HOL.1000.a:0 "Oh god..."
 TWR_HOL.10000.t:0 "Military Loses Control"
 TWR_HOL.10000.d:0 "Reports from our crowd control forces have indicated that the riots have been infiltrated by armed insurgents, and majority of the East Indies have been taken over by riots, some of which have grown into full scale revolts.\n\nDutch reservists and all other military formations have been ordered to mobilise. But, judging by the current situation at hand, it seems that the unrest has finally gotten out of control, as it is no longer about Sukarno, but about the freedom for Indonesia as a whole."
 TWR_HOL.10000.a:0 "Prepare for battle!"
 TWR_HOL.1001.t:0 "Formation of the Confederational Committee"
 TWR_HOL.1001.d:0 "After the shooting in Batavia, which Indonesian Nationalists have dubbed "The Jakarta Massacre" resulted in several Toronto Accord and UN member nations pressuring the Confederational Government to reform its policies on Indonesian rights. A Committee has been set up to review and reform the country's political system to appease the masses, and to finalise the meaning of Confederational Act for Indonesians and Dutch to follow. The PNI expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Confederational Government when it comes to reforms and the betterment of Indonesia as a whole."
 TWR_HOL.1001.a:0 "This will calm them down."
 TWR_HOL.1002.t:0 "Election Suspended"
 TWR_HOL.1002.d:0 "After days of investigation by the Committee, they have announced that the Indonesian National Party's declration is illegal, and claim that the Confederational Act does not indicate equal rights between Dutch and Indonesians. They have proclaimed that Indonesians do not deserve political rights or equal citizenship rights of Dutch nationals, and as a "Protective measure", they have suggested to suspend the upcoming election, in order to stablise the current turmoil in the nation. This result has enraged the PNI and millions of Indonesians, and Sukarno is now calling for armed conflict against the Confederational Government."
 TWR_HOL.1002.a:0 "The best possible outcome...?"
 TWR_HOL.1003.t:0 "National Protest"
 TWR_HOL.1003.d:0 "All across the East Indies, demonstrations are held to voice hatred against the Confederational Government, declaring the Dutch have "lost their mind", and the only way for Indonesians to earn equal rights is to rise up in revolution. Figures in our Confederational Government have denounced these acts as terrorism, and Governors have been ordered to mobilise their local garrisons to put down these protests. British and American embassies are evacuated for safety."
 TWR_HOL.1003.a:0 "Suppress them!"

 TWR_HOL.2000.t:0 "East Indies Retreat"
 TWR_HOL.2000.d:0 "The situation in the East Indies seems to be hopeless. The Dutch Government has relocated to Dutch Suriname, and has left remaining Dutch-held territory in the East Indies in the hands of the local garrisons. An emergency council appointed by the Queen reports that the Indonesian War is lost, and the best action is to make a plea deal to the United Nations. A request to the United Nations is sent as the Dutch troops are ordered to hold out for as long as possible."
 TWR_HOL.2000.a:0 "Send them a message..."

 TWR_HOL.2001.t:0 "Indonesian Resolution"
 TWR_HOL.2001.d:0 "The U.N Council was alerted when requests from Netherlands arrived. The Dutch have agreed to surrender large amount of Indonesia and recognise the Republic of Indonesia as a sovereign nation. An emergency voting session has called, and all of the U.N Security Council has been summoned. While an independent Indonesia might be beneficial to many of the western powers, the question has arisen as to whether Indonesia would become a Pro-Chinese or Pro-Western nation."
 TWR_HOL.2001.a:0 "Vote Aye."
 TWR_HOL.2001.b:0 "Vote Nay."

 TWR_HOL.2002.t:0 "Dutch-Indonesian Ceasefire"
 TWR_HOL.2002.d:0 "The UN Council has approved the peace plan and a ceasefire between Indonesian and Dutch Forces has been put into effect. This will bring an end to the conflict, and give both sides some time to count their losses."
 TWR_HOL.2002.a:0 "Count the losses."

 TWR_HOL.2003.t:0 "Dutch-Indonesian Ceasefire"
 TWR_HOL.2003.d:0 "The cry for Indonesian Freedom has been heard throughout the world. The Dutch have agreed to stop the fighting, and the United Nations Council is on our side. A ceasefire has been enacted and we have siezed control over the entirety of Java Island."
 TWR_HOL.2003.a:0 "A great day for Indonesia!"

 TWR_HOL.2004.t:0 "Handover of Indonesia"
 TWR_HOL.2004.d:0 "The cooldown period for the resolution has passed, and it's time for the Netherlands to let go of Indonesia. While we agreed on a full retreat, we were allowed to maintain control over Dutch New Guinea.\n\nThe Age of the Dutch East Indies is over, and our new home away from home in South America awaits."
 TWR_HOL.2004.a:0 "Farewell, East Indies."

 TWR_HOL.2005.t:0 "Indonesian Independence Ensured"
 TWR_HOL.2005.d:0 "The handover has officially been enacted. Indonesia is now united and free from Dutch rule. However, Dutch New Guinea remains a stronghold of Dutch influence in East Indies, but due to political and diplomatic reasons, they were not allowed to be part of the new Indonesian Republic. However, the dream of a Greater Indonesia will never fade, and one day Indonesia will reunite with New Guinea."
 TWR_HOL.2005.a:0 "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika!"

 TWR_HOL.2006.t:0 "Establishment of the Dutch New Guinea"
 TWR_HOL.2006.d:0 "To justify the Netherlands' rulership in New Guinea, a colonial administration has been set up in the region, with a Dutch appointed governor and a limited amount of freedom granted to the locals. While this might be a shadow of what the Dutch East Indies represented before, this will give us at least some amount of influence in South East Asia."
 TWR_HOL.2006.a:0 "Loyal, Honest, Affectionate!"

 TWR_HOL.1004.t:0 "Victory in Indonesia"
 TWR_HOL.1004.d:0 "As major fighting stops in the major centers, the revolution has largely been suppressed.\n\nBut to prevent yet another major revolt, which we would have no chance to recover from, we must take actions in preventing another crisis from happening again."
 TWR_HOL.1004.a:0 "The Confederation stands!"

 TWR_HOL.2007.t:0 "Total Defeat in Indonesia"
 TWR_HOL.2007.d:0 "As our last garrisons retreat from the Dutch East Indies, it is for the last time, as we have been completely defeated by the Indonesian guerrillas. While we still hold West Papua, as well as Suriname and our Caribbean territories, the metaphorical rug has been swept out from under us, as the centre of our exiled government is gone. The British government, thankfully, has offered to take us under its wing, although at some cost to our independence."
 TWR_HOL.2007.a:0 "We have been defeated."

 #Intro Event
 TWR_HOL_intro.1.t:0 "Dutch Government in Exile"
 TWR_HOL_intro.1.d:0 "What is left of the old government of the Netherlands is in a severely weakened state. The Nazi conquest of Europe in 1940 led to the Netherlands being occupied, and later annexed, into the 'Greater German Reich', and the Dutch government was forced to flee in exile to the East Indies. This respite would be short-lived, however, as the next year, disaster struck yet again, and most of the territory of the Dutch East Indies came under Japanese occupation. \n\nAfter allied victory in the Pacific war, the East Indies were 'liberated' back to their old colonial masters. However, the Indonesian people who had fought against the Japanese invaders, now demand independence, and constantly resist against their exiled colonial overlords. With the old colony teetering on the edge of collapse, it has come under heavy British influence, but even the fading British Empire cannot hold back the forces of freedom in Indonesia. It seems likely that a large-scale rebellion will break out at any moment."
