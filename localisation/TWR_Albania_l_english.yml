twralbania.1.t:0 "Communist Partisans Sighted in Kosovo"
twralbania.1.d:0 "For the first time since the beginning of the war, partisan activity has surged again. We believed that we had managed to wipe out all the PPSh communists back in the 40s but according to recent reports from our patrols near the Serbian border, an abandoned camp was reportedly discovered with a red star pin being found in amongst the rubble. The camp was recent, with the fire having burned out only a few hours ago. \n\nNow with our overlords being busy with their own war, we can only hope it was just an exaggerated report."
twralbania.1.a:0 "This must be a misunderstanding"
twralbania.2.t:0 "Yugoslav-Albanian Meeting"
twralbania.2.d:0 "During the dead of night, our soldiers on patrol at the Serbian border became lost and accidentally crossed into Serbian territory. During that time, they found a small shack in the middle of an empty field with light coming from inside. Upon closer inspection, the soldiers saw Yugoslav and Albanian partisans discussing over a map before being discovered and shot at. The soldiers managed to escape by the skin of their teeth and reported the incident immediatelly. After informing the Serbian border authorities of this incident, they reported back that they only found charred remains where the shack stood."
twralbania.2.a:0 "This is becoming more and more concerning..."
twralbania.3.t:0 "Whole Village Goes Missing"
twralbania.3.d:0 "Found through a local newspaper article, the population of a tiny village in Kosovo has gone missing! According to the article, the village consisted of 65 people, all of whom were farmers and had little contact with the state outside of a few legal and economic items that they had to go to the closest town to take care of. The person that found the village abandoned was the postman who was carrying a single letter for one of its inhabitants but failed to find anyone. Authorities investigated the area but couldnt find anything apart from a flag of the Lëvizja Antifashiste Nacionale Çlirimtare, raising suspicions that the partisans may be involved in the dissapearance. For now, we have covered up the story by giving a vague statement that the village was relocated for safety reasons."
twralbania.3.a:0 "The partisans are recruiting people!"
twralbania.4.t:0 "Partisans Raid Weapon Storage"
twralbania.4.d:0 "Our morning work started out rough today as we received a report of one of our weapon storage depots near the Serbian border having been ransacked by partisans the previous night. With the combinatiion of easily bribed guards on duty and secrecy, the partisans managed to empty out the whole storage, stealing guns, explosives, ammunition and even the bycicle of the local lieutenant. The situation is getting increasingly grim and we must begin acting... but with what means?"
twralbania.4.a:0 "Cover up the incident and replace the bycicle!"
twralbania.5.t:0 "Partisans Attack Military Headquarters in Kosovo"
twralbania.5.d:0 "\n\nWe received reports from Kosovo again bearing bad news. Our military headquarters in the area were attacked by a sudden ambush set by the partisans. The battle was a bloodbath for our men, with all 37 in headquarters dying by the bloody hand of the communists. Lacking any actual replacements for the officers lost, we gave the positions to some loyalists as to cover up the incident but news got out fast and things have been going downhill. Citizens, tired of Italian rule, have started to show up more and more around the urban centers of Albania, with minor clashes being reported between the Albanian Fascist Militia and the Anti-Italians."
twralbania.5.a:0 "Something big is coming..."
twralbania.6.t:0 "Partisans Destroy Rail Connections"
twralbania.6.d:0 "From all around Albania, we have been getting reports of partisans sabotaging our rail infastructure by blowing up connection points, brigdes and even one train carrying weapons from Italy. News of the attacks immediatelly spread as partisan papers were distributed around the cities, calling the people to revolt against the Italian-imposed oligarchy. More and more clashes have been going on and some police stations have been raided by citizens while members of the Fascist Militia have been found dead, hanging from trees."
twralbania.6.a:0 "Prepare all forces for war!"
twralbania.6.b:0 "We need help from Rome!"
twralbania.61.t:0 "Albania Asks For Support"
twralbania.61.d:0 "The situation in Albania has worsened, and the Albanian Government is requesting out reinforcements to suppress a potential communist conflict."
twralbania.61.a:0 "Send them the help."
twralbania.61.b:0 "We can't risk it."
twralbania.62.t:0 "Rome Reinforcements"
twralbania.62.d:0 "The Italian Empire has sent us some much needed reinforcements to suppress the communist rebels. With these professionals, the rebel cells were swiftly destroyed."
twralbania.62.a:0 "Good!"
twralbania.7.t:0 "Communist Partisans Coup Government"
twralbania.7.d:0 "With all the chaos and unrest that has spread around our country, the government has completely lost control over its territory. The Fascist Militia have been seen around the capital running away in fear from the crowds of revolting citizens while in the countryside, anyone who collaborated with the Italians was swiftly captured and humilitiated to the fullest by the locals. More and more villages saw the Albanian flag with the Yellow star rise as old flag was burned. Cities have fallen to the Partisan-led masses and the government palace is being stormed by the people bearing all kinds of weapons, fighting through against all those who oppose them. Several figures commit suicide as to avoid capture while others are thrown of the windows of the palace by the partisans, finding their end as they hit the ground. \n\nAs Mustafa Merlika-Kruja was put against the wall for execution, the leader of the partisans and of the PPSh, Enver Hoxha, took command, issuing his first order as the General Secretary of Albania for the establishment of the People's Republic of Albania and the official end of fascism in Albania."
twralbania.7.a:0 "Lavdi Enver Hoxhës!"
twralbania.8.t:0 "Albanian Revolution"
twralbania.8.d:0 "Tirana is an upheaval today as the Albanian Party of Labour, led by communist revolutionary Enver Hoxha, has succeeded in taking power from the pro-Italian administration. Citing a fascist government that was more concerned with pandering to their overlords in Rome than providing a decent life for the Albania people, the communists declared that Albania will now be a people's republic, seeking to achieve socialism in the mold of the severed Soviet Union. The Italian garrisons have been driven out of all the major cities, and many experts see this as another example of Italy's weakening grip over her empire. Whether or not the Albanian revolution will be a prolonged one is yet to be seen."
twralbania.8.a:0 "A small slice of Europe has been painted red."

twrbelgradepact.1.t:0 "The Belgrade Pact Proposal"
twrbelgradepact.1.d:0 "Having both ousted the fascists from our homelands and beaten back all enemies, Albania and Yugoslavia both stand as two communist nations against the fascist world. Allied together since before the revolution, Albanians and Yugoslavs are brothers in arms, minds and spirits. Thus, in order to defend our homelands, we propose the creation of the Belgrade Pact, a defensive alliance between our nations ensuring mutual trust and defense. Hopefully our Yugoslav brothers will join us in establishing a stronger front against the fascists and capitalists."
twrbelgradepact.1.a:0 "Onward for the United Front!"
twrbelgradepact.2.t:0 "Proposal from Albania"
twrbelgradepact.2.d:0 "Our allies in the South have made an interesting proposal to us. With the deep ties between our people and the common history of battle and revolution, we have fought one alongside the other in the hardest of times. Now, they suggest we continue that by establishing a defensive alliance. Approving of the proposal would be a great boost to our defensive capabilities, having the Albanians on our side, we will be able to fight with a stronger force against any fascist force there is. On the other hand, is it really worth dying for Albania?"
twrbelgradepact.2.a:0 "A United Front is what we need!"
twrbelgradepact.2.b:0 "The Albanians will have to fend for themselves"
twrbelgradepact.3.t:0 "Yugoslavia Accepts"
twrbelgradepact.3.d:0 "In a historic meeting in Belgrade, Enver Hoxha and Josip Broz Tito have signed the mutual agreement for the establishment of the Belgrade Pact, establishing mutual cooperation and defense between the two nations."
twrbelgradepact.3.a:0 "The United Front has formed!"
twrbelgradepact.4.t:0 "Yugoslavia Refuses"
twrbelgradepact.4.d:0 "In a sad turn of events, the Yugoslavians have refused the offer for the establishment of the Belgrade Pact, citing reasons of safety and world politics against it. The decision has left the Albanian government dissapointed but it has still gone forward and established the Tirana Pact, in hopes of achieving alliances in the future with more of its neighbours."
twrbelgradepact.4.a:0 "The United Front has failed!"

#Leader Descriptions
Enver_Desc:0 "Enver Hoxha is the charismatic leader of the Albanian partisans, a true revolutionary in every sense of the word, and a man with lofty goals and ambitions for a free and communist Albania. Born in 1908 under Ottoman rule, he is a learned man and has fought for years against the Italians, first under the Party of Labour of Albania (PPSH)  militias, and then as the commissar of the Albanian National Liberation Army, the united partisan force, comprised mainly of the National Front and the PPSH, two ideologically different parties united against the fascist oppressors. After years of fighting, the PPSH took central control of the partisan forces from the National Front after they sided with the fascists, and Hoxha now stands as the leader of the resistance in occupied Albania. Despite attempts to crack down on the partisans they have not been extinguished yet, and as time goes on and the fascist powers grow weaker, perhaps a time will come when Hoxha's dreams can become reality. Whether his goals are even realistic is debatable, but Hoxha and the Partisans are willing to give everything they have, even their lives, to achieve them."
