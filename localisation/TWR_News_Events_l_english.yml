twrnews.1.t:0 "Shady Dealings in the Reich"
twrnews.1.d:0 "According to reports provided by a secret informant, there have been numerous incidents of murder and assassinations in the midst of the ongoing political turmoil within the Reich, with many high ranking German officials falling victim to unknown attackers. While official reports claim that said murders were \"Plotted by Subhuman Terrorists\", leaked memoranda from the Orpo High Command suggest that these assassinations were in fact ordered by an unknown member of Hitler's Inner Circle, presumably in an attempt to tip the political scale in their favor. \n\nGermania has yet to release an official statement regarding the recent events."
twrnews.1.a:0 "Intriguing."

twrnews.2.t:0 "Congo Rebellion Crushed"
#twrnews.2.d:0 "Ever since the Belgian government fled to their colony in the Congo following the Nazi invasion of the Low Countries, the stability of the Belgian Congo has been very inconsistent. While revolutionary movements had existed for a long time, a full-scale rebellion in the east of the colony had begun a few months ago, seizing large amounts of territory across the vast territories of the Congo. Now, however, with Belgian authorities back in full control with backing from their British allies, the movement has been pushed back underground and the rebellion is considered over. However, as long as Belgium's harsh colonial rule continues, troubles are sure to persist."
twrnews.2.d:0 "The Belgian Congo Colony had always been in a semi-unruly state. When the Nazis invaded the Low Countries, the Belgian Government was forced to withdraw to its last posession in Africa. Ever since then, harsh minority rule has led to increasing tensions within the region, which had culminated in open rebellion led by long-standing revolutionary groups in the east of the colony. Despite some initial successes during the early months, full Belgian authority to the Congo has now finally been restored, thanks to extensive support from allied British forces. However, though the rebellion was subdued, revolutionary organisations still persist underground, and with the continuing Belgian minority rule, their support is growing from day to day."
twrnews.2.a:0 "Interesting."

twrnews.3.t:0 "\"Anti-Bolshevik Air War\""
#twrnews.3.d:0 "In an act that shocked the world, Germany has launched a 'War' against the remnants of the Soviet Union. Due to the instability of the Reichskommissariats and possibly a weak supply lines for a ground offensive, however, the German government announced that they will rely solely on air raids and bombing runs to bring the remaining Soviet survivors to their knees. The reaction of this sudden war has been shock and fear across the region, while reports say that some Germans are doubtful of the usefulness of this war. However, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels claims that the German people decided on this war to finally crush the enemies of the German people once and for all, and will be united behind it."
twrnews.3.d:0 "In an act that shocked the world, Germany has launched a new 'War' against the remnants of the Soviet Union. The German government has declared that the \"rotten Bolshevik cockroaches\" will finally be brought to their heels with an extensive aerial campaign consisting of constant air raids and non-stop bombing runs. Curiously, the official government statement mentioned no conventional invasion by means of land forces, presumably due to the dire state of disorder in the eastern Reichskommissariats, hampering any attempts at effectively transporting and supplying large combat forces.\n\nWhile many in the soon to be bombed region have been stunned by fear and shock from the sudden declaration, some observers from the reich have offered tacit criticism in regards to the sensibility and usefulness of the campaign.""

twrnews.4.t:0 "The End of the Air War"
#twrnews.4.d:0 "The Air War has come to a close after many souls on both sides were lost. German officials have proclaimed the ending of all air operations from now on until future notice, and the Soviets proclaimed a "Victory" against the Nazi machines. It's unknown why the war was launched, and serious doubts were raised about if the war even had a chance of achieving anything of value."
twrnews.4.d:0 "The Air War has finally come to a close after many souls on both sides were lost. German officials have proclaimed an end to all aerial operations from now on until future notice, and the Soviets proclaimed a \"Victory\" against the Nazi flying machines. Mounting operational costs and a lack of any noteworthy gains outside of the addition of new craters to the Russian expanses, in addition to mounting criticism in regards to the lack of operational effectiveness have brought on an end to the pointless conflict."

twrnews.6.t:0 "The Southern Uprising"
#twrnews.6.d:0 "Around the Southern regions of Generalgouvernement, the Poles and Ukrainians have risen up to combat the German government. The Polish Home Army successfully captured Lemberg, with the Ukrainian's Lviv Liberation Army capturing regions South of Lemberg with relatively ease. The Poles and Ukrainians have forged a temporary alliance, and with two groups united as one, their chance of achieving victory might have been increased noticably.\n\nRumours of Home Army activities all across Poland have been reported, and this begs the question - Is the end of German control over Poland on the horizon?"
twrnews.6.d:0 "Polish and Ukrainian Insurgents have risen up in the Southern regions of the German Generalgouvernement! The Polish Home Army has seized Lemberg and already established a base of operations inside the liberated city, while the Ukrainian Lviv Liberation Army has seized the territories around Stanislaviv south of now-renamed Lwów. While both Poles and Ukrainians have contested the Galician area in the past, the two groups have put their disagreements aside in favour of a temporary alliance to fight off their common Nazi oppressors.\n\nAt the same time, unconfirmed rumours tell of rising Home Army activity across the rest of Polish territory, and some observers, both within and without the Reich, have already begun to question continued German reign in Poland and beyond."
twrnews.6.a:0 "Those thrice-damned Slavs!"
twrnews.6.b:0 "Here come the Poles..."

twrnews.7.t:0 "The Prague Uprising"
#twrnews.7.d:0 "Strangely, Czechs and Germans in Prague have seemingly united, tired of the chaos and instability in Germany. What started off as a peaceful protest very quickly turned violent after a harsh crackdown from local forces. The German Officials in Prague ordered troops to open fire, while rebels smuggled in weapons to arm the protestors. The latest reports detail that Prague has seemingly fallen firmly into rebel hands, but they also suggest that this revolt will likely be ended swiftly by coming German reinforcements."
twrnews.7.d:0 "What started off as a peaceful protest very quickly turned violent after a harsh crackdown from the local garrison. The German Officials ordered troops to open fire on the protestors, while rebels smuggled in weapons to arm the protestors. Surprisingly, it seems that both Germans and Czechs were found at the side of the rebels, seemingly both tired of the chaos and instability in Germany.\n\nThe latest reports indicate that the Bohemian capital has fallen entirely into rebel hands, though German reinforcements have already been spotted en route to the city. Only time will tell if the rebels can hold their position."
twrnews.7.a:0 "They will pay for this!"
twrnews.7.b:0 "Czechs?"

twrnews.8.t:0 "The German Spring"
#twrnews.8.d:0 "Germania's U-Bahn network has been a hotbed of fighting since the outbreak of German Civil War. Forces from all sides were unable to fully take control underground due to the sheer size and complexity of the tunnel networks, creating a strange situation where a metro war is constantly happening underground almost entirely separate to the events above ground. However, just recently, the Leftist and Democratic rebels in the U-Bahn have formed a United Front, calling for people's rule and the end of all wars and violent, Nazi rule. Arming themselves with smuggled weapons, they successfully launched a surprise attack from underground and captured large chunks of Germania, while the Volkshalle's situation remains unknown."
twrnews.8.d:0 "Germania's U-Bahn network has been a hotbed of fighting since the outbreak of the German Civil War. Until recently, none of the factions have been able to take full control over the underground, as the sheer size and complexity of the tunnel network limited any comprehensive large-scale operation. This had resulted in an odd situation where faction control underground could deviate wildly from faction control on the surface. However, just recently, Leftist and Pro-Democratic rebels sheltered in the U-Bahn have formed a United Front, calling for people's rule and the end of all wars and violent Nazi oppression. Having armed themselves with smuggled weapons, they successfully launched a surprise attack from the underground and captured large areas of Germania. Throughout all of this turmoil, the state of the Volkshalle remains unknown."
twrnews.8.a:0 "What!?"
twrnews.8.b:0 "Even the Germans are tired!"

twrnews.9.t:0 "The Slovakian Resignation"
twrnews.9.d:0 "Reports from Bratislava show that a coup has occured. The fascist Tiso regime has been ousted and replaced with a Citizen-Military Government, proclaiming themselves to be the Second Slovak Republic. Reports indicate no German forces were garrisoned in Slovakia during the coup, since all the garrisons were redirected to fight in the Civil War. While this new government will most likely be crushed, for now they enjoy the taste of freedom that many Slovaks have long hoped for."
twrnews.9.a:0 "We will come back for you!"
twrnews.9.b:0 "This just show how weak the Germans are..."

twrnews.10.t:0 "Hungarian Invasion of Slovakia"
twrnews.10.d:0 "After the proclamation of the state in Slovakia, Horthy's Hungarian Government in Budapest declared their support for the 'rightful government' before launching an invasion of Slovakia. The Slovakian National Council has issued an order that all Slovaks must take part in the defense of the nation against the Hungarian invaders, while volunteers are rushing to the aid of their Fatherland, attempting to defend Slovakia from the materially and numerically superior Hungarian forces."
twrnews.10.a:0 "Go get them, Hungary!"
twrnews.10.b:0 "This was expected."

twrnews.12.t:0 "The Opening of Germania Metro"
twrnews.12.d:0 "A project launched right after the end of the German-Soviet War, and sped up by fear of atomic destruction, Germany announced it has constructed a large and complicated metro system unseen anywhere else before, connecting not only parts of central Germania, but also suburbs and neighbourhoods further out. Albert Speer - the overseer of this project, claimed that this new metro would provide the people of Germania a "A faster and safer way to travel", and greatly reflect the "Aryan engineering superiority". Nevertheless, this marks a great point in human history, and an inspiration for large-scale underground transportation across the world."
twrnews.12.a:0 "Impressive."

twrnews.13.t:0 "The Slavic Revolt"
twrnews.13.d:0 "Reichskommissariat control in Moscow has always been among the most unstable in the Reich. Titled as the Slave State by outsiders, the oppressed Russian people have finally built up the courage to rise up after catching wind of the death of Hitler. While some might argue that the rebellion was bound to happen, the revolt was certainly emboldened by the Hitler's recent death and the instability it has caused in the German government. \n\nNow, with the revolution in full swing, is this the sign for what's to come?"
twrnews.13.a:0 "Moskau, Moskau..."

twrnews.14.t:0 "Britain Tests an Atomic Bomb"
twrnews.14.d:0 "Today, the British Government announced that the United Kingdom achieved what only the United States and, more recently, Nazi Germany had accomplished - the development and testing of an atomic bomb.\n\nWith tensions already high between the two powers across the channel, the development of Britain's own nuclear capabilities is only likely to increase the chance of war reerupting in western Europe. In Britain, it is being hailed as a great achievement, and a sign of Britain's determination and ability to defend itself from any German aggression. The German government itself has not released any statement, but it's likely that this is worrying news in Germania."
twrnews.14.a:0 "Interesting."
twrnews.14.b:0 "The British have nukes!"

twrnews.15.t:0 "Swiss Revolution"
twrnews.15.d:0 "Switzerland's backup plan that was set in place for a post Nazi occupation has finally been activated. The secret army that hid in the Alps have emerged, under the leadership of Henri Guisan, seeking to restore the Swiss Confederation under its old democratic values. Guisan has declared himself as the Provisional Chief of Switzerland, declaring his full loyalty to the Swiss Government in Exile. Several overseas Swiss organisations have raised funds, attempting to smuggle support into Switzerland with the help of dissidents in Germany, France and Italy."
twrnews.15.a:0 "The Swiss are angry too?"
twrnews.15.b:0 "Degenerates!"

twrnews.17.t:0 "Start of the Benelux Revolution"
twrnews.17.d:0 "Reports detailing a Belgian Uprising reached agencies all around the world. While the revolt might seem to be yet another ethnic revolt in Germany, there are details suggesting that this is merely a start of a chain reaction, a starting point for a general revolution across the Low Countries. Experts suggest that a similar Dutch Uprising or perhaps a Luxembourger Uprising might occur within days. With Germany in such chaos, oversea exiled Dutch and Belgians are forming volunteer brigades and are planning to join the rebellion."
twrnews.17.a:0 "Damn..."
twrnews.17.b:0 "Deutschland über alles!"

twrnews.16.t:0 "Germany Tests an Atomic Bomb"
twrnews.16.d:0 "Just hours ago, the government of Germany announced the success of its first ever atomic bomb test. The test was performed in the remote arctic region of Reichskommissariat Moskowien on February 19, and the relatively low yield weapon successfully detonated.\n\nGermania now claims that it has proven that it can match the Toronto Accord in terms of nuclear capabilities. However, military experts in the West have suggested that the announcement around the test is a bluff, and Germany does not have the full capabilities to produce atomic bombs on an industrial scale, unlike the United States. Nonetheless, a clear demonstration of theoretical nuclear capability from Germany is something that west had long feared, and now is a reality."
twrnews.16.a:0 "We'll see..."
twrnews.16.b:0 "Germany will march on!"

twrnews.18.t:0 "Labour Wins UK Elections"
twrnews.18.d:0 "Prime Minister Clement Attlee certainly made a gamble in calling a general election, and it appears to have paid off. The Labour Party have successfully won back their majority, and Clement Attlee has met with the Queen to be asked to form a new government. \nHowever, uncertainty still surrounds the longtime Labour leader, and a renewed mandate is not going to make them disappear. The party has continued division over issues such as economic and foreign affairs; it is left to Mr. Attlee to unite the party and prevent it falling into disrepute. Can this new Attlee ministry survive the test of history? Only time shall tell."
twrnews.18.a:0 "Interesting."

twrnews.19.t:0 "Conservatives Win UK Elections"
twrnews.19.d:0 "Prime Minister Clement Attlee has been voted out of office, and has met the Queen earlier today where offered his resignation. His only advice to Her Majesty was to send for the Opposition Leader, Mr. Butler, to form a new government. The new Prime Minister was always optimistic of his party's chances at this election and it seems he has good foresight. Now Mr. Butler will set out forming the first solely Conservative government since before the armistice with Germany. \nNow Mr. Butler is in Downing Street, promising to create a "strong and free" Britain as pledged in his party's manifesto. The new Prime Minister emphasised the need for change in an increasingly vague and dangerous political climate, whether such change can be achieved only remains to be seen."
twrnews.19.a:0 "Interesting."

twrnews.20.t:0 "Union Movement Wins Elections"
twrnews.20.d:0 "A man once ostracised from the forefront of politics, Sir Oswald Mosley has perhaps made the greatest political comeback in history. Mosley met the Queen earlier today where he was asked to form a government. Upon entering Downing Street, Mosley formed the first Union Movement government in British history. Watching these events unfold, it is hard to believe the political journey of such a man. The first British premier since Lloyd George to be neither Labour or Conservative.\nNow the task falls on him to bring the nation together, in an ever increasing period of uncertainty. Winning by one of the slimmest margins in history, even now as the government has been formed there are disputes over the overall national vote. Nonetheless, this election will perhaps go down as the most dramatic in British history."
twrnews.20.a:0 "Interesting."

twrnews.21.t:0 "No Clear Winner in UK"
twrnews.21.d:0 "One of the most dramatic general elections for a generation is over, and has resulted in no party achieving overall control of the House of Commons. The Prime Minister made a gamble in calling the general election, and it appears to have backfired. Instead of winning back Labour's majority, Mr. Attlee has lost even more seats. \nIn the next few weeks, Labour may be forced to make an alliance with minor parties such as the Liberals. Butler's Conservatives could even be the one forming the next government with other parties. Mosley's small but growing Union Movement may make things much more difficult.\nAttlee's position may now be viewed as untenable after this disaster for his increasingly factional party. Now we must ask, is the British public ready for yet another coalition government?"
twrnews.21.a:0 "Interesting."

twrnews.22.t:0 "Rhee Resigns"
twrnews.22.d:0 "The protests that had been steadily building steam had reached a peak, and seeing his power over the nation and army deteriorating, President Syngman Rhee was forced to resign, and is believed to have left the country. \nThough he ruled under the pretense of an American-style liberal democracy, his relatively short-lived regime was characterised by authoritarianism and suppression of political and civil rights. With the great president now gone and the sudden power vacuum it has created, there are hopes from some of a true parliamentary democratic system, while others a pushing to drive the country in a more radical direction. \nIt remains to be seen what will happen next."
twrnews.22.a:0 "Another country changes course..."

twrnews.23.t:0 "Korean Protests Crushed"
twrnews.23.d:0 "Although many thought the gathering protests against Rhee's regime would bring change, with the army choosing to stick by the old 'President', the massed crowds were forcibly dispersed, even with gunfire in places, leaving dozens dead. Its leaders are being hunted down and arrested, and any hope of government change in the near future has been shattered. \nA further crackdown on already erode rights and even a 'purge' is likely to come for Syngman Rhee to cement his previously shaky rule, which for the time being seems to be here to stay."
twrnews.23.a:0 "Change is not always easy..."

twrnews.24.t:0 "Indonesian National Revolution"
twrnews.24.d:0 "Just as many believed the unrest between Indonesians and Dutch were never meant to be fixed.\n\nRecent news have supported this theory, with a supposedly routine riot spiralling into a full full-blown revolution. A national government has been proclaimed by the Indonesians, rejecting to acknowledge Dutch authority over the East Indies.\n\nThis revolution is the result of systemic inequality within this supposedly \"Confederation\", to the point where one man that isn't even in Indonesia can spark such a large-scale national revolution."

twrnews.25.d:0 "Debate in the United Nations ended with a resolution to end the Indonesian War once and for all. A temporary ceasefire has been enacted under the advisery of the United Nations, while the process for transition towards Indonesian nationhood is underway. The Government of the Netherlands has agreed to a withdrawal from Indonesia, but the peace settlement allows the Netherlands to keep their control over Dutch New Guinea for the time being. While the Indonesian government is in favour of this peace deal, this settlement is unlikely to be permanent on its own, and will require a later full resolution."
twrnews.25.a:0 "Peace in the Indies?"

twrnews.26.t:0 "Indonesian Resolution Rejected"
twrnews.26.d:0 "Debate in the United Nations ended with a resolution rejected. Dutch Forces remain trapped in a conflict with the Indonesians, with the only solution being a separated peace deal which would favour Indonesia massively. The Dutch Government has stated their willingness to strive for more favourable conditions in a peace talks with Indonesia, and without the supervision of United Nations, any attempts of ceasefire between Dutch Forces and Indonesians are met with failures."
twrnews.26.a:0 "Huh."

twrnews.29.t:0 "Indonesian Victory in East Indies"
twrnews.29.d:0 "With the conflict between the Dutch and Indonesians settled, Indonesia has successfully achieved nationhood. Millions celebrated, but they also cried out for the release of Sukarno from illegal captivity. The Government of the Netherlands has been forced to recognise Indonesia's status as a nation and expressed their respect towards Indonesian national boundaries. Diplomatically, both the Toronto Accord and the Republic of China both show great interest in drawing the newly created Free Indonesia towards their respective blocs, which might spark yet another dispute in Asia."

twrnews.30.t:0 "Exile of the Dutch Government"
twrnews.30.d:0 "The Dutch government-in-exile, located in Indonesia, has once again relocated to another base of operations. Its personnel and other members have been evacuated to the Dutch colony of Suriname, declaring an end to the Confederational Status between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The remaining areas of Dutch control in Indonesia are now under the direct control of the Dutch Colonial Army, and widespread panic in these areas are reported, as White Dutch settlers in these areas scramble to board refugee ships bounded for Australia and Singapore. The Toronto Accord has sent humanitarian aid for both Indonesians and Dutch Refugees, claiming to be neutral in this conflict."

twrnews.32.d:0 "Despite their low popularity, the People's alliance has won the 1953 Icelandic Election. The Progressive Party and Independence Party have both voiced their protest in questioning the legitimacy of the election, with the United States of America has showed mild disapproval towards this result, though ultimately choosing to tentatively recognise the new government. This might signal a rise of Isolationism in Iceland, in order to combat against Toronto Accord and American influence and ensure Icelandic neutrality in any upcoming conflicts."

twrnews.33.d:0 "The influence of Nazi Germany on Swedish politics has proven to be one that's unavoidable. Despite Sweden's countless attempts at being balanced between the Toronto Accord and Germany, the Far Right has risen in an unexpected shift that defeated the country's political mainstream. The New Swedish Movement, possibly aided by the Germans, has successfully expanded its ranks and securing a spot as one of the top political parties of Sweden, and with the recent victory, Sweden will soon see it's first, elected fascistic Prime Minister.\n\nThe Social Democrats, united with the People's and Rightist parties, have filed the necessary documents to sue, accusing this election as fraudulent and meddled by German intervention."

twrnews.34.d:0 "The last, tattered remains of the once mighty 'Greater German Reich' has surrendered. With its collapse, the full horrifying extent of its reign of terror across Europe has become apparent - tens of millions have been killed, and tens of millions more enslaved. Deep scars have been created across Europe. Shocking evil was committed on a scale not before seen in history. At last, with the total destruction of the 'Reich' that was marched towards insanity by the scourge of Nazism, it seems the era of death, destruction and madness that gripped Europe ever since the fall of Poland and France is finally over. Officials of all the allied nations that struggled against Nazism have promised a new beginning, in which peace, order and freedom will be reestablished in Europe."

Diplomats and representatives from all the major powers that fought against Germany, as well as the various rebel groups, revolutionary governments and governments in exile, have met together to begin discussions on how to organise the post-Nazi world. The US, as by far the most powerful of the meeting powers, will lead the negotiations, and their choices will have huge sway over the eventual decisions of the assembly as a whole.\n\nAs the negotiations were opened, it was declared that a new order would be created, but this time a new order built on peace and justice, not one based on tyranny and oppression."

twrnews.37.d:0 "After a brief election and debate, Slovenia has peacefully seperated itself from Germany. Due to the inability of the Heer Junta to spend resources on Slovenia, they have decided to ignore the Slovenian Proclamation and focus on internal issues. The new Sloevnian Government has kept many fascistic elements of the Home Guards, with active Yugoslav Partisan resistance resurgent in the Slovenian Region without the threat of German reprisal. Some experts suggest that Austria might soon follow in declaring independence to protect themselves from the seemingly endless and destructive Civil War."

As a result, his campaign promise of leaving the TA has now been fulfilled, with the British representative to the TA Council submitting the UK's withdrawal from the alliance. \nThis was unsurprisingly met with much criticism, both domestically and from abroad.

Later that day, protesters alongside the militia Forces formed by fanatical students managed to seize the apparatus of state and overthrow the Japanese Government. \n\nThe Foregin Garrisons in Japan are unharmed in their bases, but the young post-war government has been dragged from power."

gcw.1110.d:0 "After the outbreak of German Civil War, Rudolf Hess fled Germany on a stolen bomber. He was reported missing from his estate just mere days ago, and while the German government seemingly paid little attention to this, recent information about an unidentified aircraft violating Swedish airspace, triggering the Swedish air defence system, has been linked with his disappearance. The pilot of this plane has been discovered to be Rudolf Hess himself, largely unharmed, and currently recovering in a hospital in southern Sweden. Rumors suggest that Rudolf Hess might seek status as a refugee until Germany is stable once again."
